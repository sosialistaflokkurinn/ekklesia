# Repository Reorganization Draft Plan

**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Purpose**: Prepare repository structure for Phase 5-6 growth (Epic #24 â†’ Multi-Tenancy)

> **Status**: COMPLETED 2025-10-21 (Commit f3ecc28)
> This was a draft plan. The actual restructuring has been completed.
> See [Repository Structure](../../DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md#-repository-structure) for current structure.
**Effort**: 40-60 hours (2-3 weeks with Haiku + Sonnet workflow)
**Risk Level**: Medium-High (impacts all developers, git operations involved)

---

## Executive Summary

The ekklesia repository is transitioning from **MVP (single hardcoded election)** to **Production Platform (dynamic multi-election, admin APIs, multi-tenancy roadmap)**. The current structure works for MVP but creates friction for:

1. **Epic #24 (Admin APIs)**: Adding 15 new issues around dynamic elections, RBAC, audit logging
2. **Phase 6 (Scaling)**: Multi-tenancy, observability, load testing infrastructure
3. **Developer Experience**: Unclear service boundaries, mixed concerns in docs/scripts
4. **Testing & QA**: Minimal test structure, no clear integration/E2E patterns
5. **Onboarding**: New developers struggle with scattered documentation and ambiguous file organization

**Proposed Approach**: Reorganize into **service-centric structure** with clear separation of concerns, enabling:
- Easier to add new services (6+ potential services in Phase 6 roadmap)
- Better developer tooling and scripts
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Clear deployment and operations patterns
- Foundation for multi-tenancy

**Issues with Current Structure:**

| Issue | Impact | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Services mixed at root** | Unclear what's a service vs utility | Is `members/` a service or just functions? |
| **Cloud Functions unclear** | Functions live inside `members/`, hard to find | `handleKenniAuth` buried in `members/functions/` |
| **Docs organization chaotic** | Hard to find what you need | Status vs guides vs design vs roadmap all at same level |
| **Scripts unclear purpose** | Don't know if safe to run | Mix of prod deployment and local testing |
| **Tests scattered** | No clear test infrastructure | Test files in various locations, ad-hoc |
| **No shared utilities** | Code duplication across services | Auth, logging, DB patterns repeated |
| **Archive not organized** | Legacy code hard to reference | ZITADEL, Portal, misc evaluations all mixed |
| **Growing pains visible** | Hard to add new services/functions | Epic #24 will add significant new code |

## Growth Trajectory (Next 12 Months)

### Phase 5 (Now â†’ 6 weeks)
- âœ… MVP complete (3 services, end-to-end voting)
- ðŸ“‹ Epic #24: Dynamic elections admin API (15 issues)
- ðŸ“‹ Infrastructure improvements (connection pooling, observability)

### Phase 6 (6 weeks â†’ 3 months)
- **Service Expansion**:
  - Admin portal (separate from Members)
  - Audit logging service
  - Notification service (email/SMS for meeting reminders)
  - Analytics service
  - Webhook service (for external integrations)
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Multi-tenancy layer
  - Advanced observability (tracing, dashboards)
  - Load testing infrastructure
  - CI/CD automation
- **Testing**:
  - Comprehensive test suite
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Chaos engineering scenarios

### Phase 7 (3 months â†’ 6 months)
- **Feature Services**:
  - Member directory service
  - Communication service
  - File storage service
- **Operations**:

## Detailed Reorganization Breakdown

### Phase 1: Service Structure (1 week)

**Goal**: Prepare for Epic #24 (Admin APIs) by establishing clear service boundaries

**Tasks**:

1. **Create `services/` directory** and reorganize:
   - Move `members/` â†’ `services/members/`
   - Move `events/` â†’ `services/events/`
   - Move `elections/` â†’ `services/elections/`
   - Create structure for 6 future services (templates)

2. **Create `functions/` directory**:
   - Extract Cloud Functions from `members/functions/` â†’ `functions/handleKenniAuth/`
   - Extract Cloud Functions â†’ `functions/verifyMembership/`
   - Create function deployment automation

3. **Create `shared/` directory** with utilities:
   - `shared/auth/` - Firebase client, JWT validation, HMAC signing
   - `shared/db/` - PostgreSQL connection pooling, query builders
   - `shared/logging/` - Structured JSON logger, audit schema
   - `shared/types/` - TypeScript types for all services
   - `shared/constants/` - Shared enums, constants

**Effort**: ~8 hours (moving files, updating imports)

**Risk**: High (affects imports across all services)

**Mitigation**:
- Create backup before starting
- Update imports in careful phases
- Test each service after moving

---

### Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure (1 week)

**Goal**: Build comprehensive test suite for Epic #24 (RBAC, audit logging, admin operations)

**Tasks**:

1. **Create `tests/` structure**:
   - `tests/unit/` - Per-service unit tests
   - `tests/integration/` - Cross-service tests (S2S auth, audit flow)
   - `tests/e2e/` - Full voting flow, admin operations
   - `tests/security/` - CSRF, injection, S2S auth
   - `tests/performance/` - Spike scenarios (300 votes/sec)

2. **Create test utilities** (`tests/fixtures/`):
   - Mock data for elections, members, votes
   - Test helpers (database seeding, cleanup)
   - Test database connection

3. **Add CI/CD workflows** (`.github/workflows/`):
   - `test.yml` - Run all tests on every PR
   - `security-scan.yml` - Security scanning
   - `coverage.yml` - Code coverage reporting

**Effort**: ~12 hours (writing test infrastructure, not all tests)

**Deliverables**:
- Test framework ready
- CI/CD pipeline configured
- ~10 example tests as template

---

### Phase 3: Documentation Reorganization (1 week)

   - `scripts/maintenance/` - Periodic maintenance
   - `scripts/testing/` - Test automation
   - `scripts/development/` - Developer tools

2. **Create script documentation**:
   - Add header comments to all scripts explaining purpose
   - Create `scripts/README.md` with descriptions
   - Add safety checks (backups before destructive operations)

3. **Add helper utilities**:
   - `scripts/lib/common.sh` - Shared functions
   - `scripts/lib/colors.sh` - Output formatting
   - `scripts/lib/validation.sh` - Input validation

**Effort**: ~6 hours (organizing, documenting)

**Deliverables**:

- Deployment automation
- Clear deployment process

---

### Phase 6: Archive & Cleanup (1 week)

**Goal**: Organize legacy code for reference without cluttering main repo

**Tasks**:

1. **Organize `archive/`**:
   - Group legacy code by age/component
   - Add README to each archive section
   - Create index of what was replaced/why

2. **Clean up root directory**:
   - Move loose files to appropriate locations
   - Remove deprecated configurations
   - Update `.gitignore`

3. **Add top-level guides**:
   - Update root `README.md` with new structure
   - Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contributors
   - Add quick links to getting started

**Effort**: ~6 hours (organizing, cleaning, documenting)

**Deliverables**:
- Clean root directory
- Well-organized archive
- Clear contribution guidelines

---

## Implementation Timeline & Effort

### Approach Options

#### Option A: Sequential (Traditional)
- **Timeline**: 5-6 weeks (one person, one phase per week)
- **Cost**: High token usage
- **Risk**: Changes sit longer, more merge conflicts
- **Quality**: Good (time for thorough testing)

#### Option B: Multi-Agent Workflow (Recommended)
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks (Haiku + Sonnet in parallel)
- **Cost**: 30-40% lower than Option A
- **Risk**: Reduced (parallel validation, QA phase)
- **Quality**: Excellent (strategic planning + execution + review)

**Recommended**: Option B using the Multi-Agent Workflow:

```
Week 1 (Sonnet Analysis + Planning):
  - Analyze current structure
  - Identify dependencies
  - Create detailed reorganization prompt

Week 1-2 (Haiku Execution):
  - Phase 1: Service structure (files, imports)
  - Phase 2: Testing infrastructure
  - Phase 3: Documentation reorganization
  - Phase 4: Scripts organization
  - Phase 5: Infrastructure setup

Week 2 (Sonnet QA):
  - Verify all imports correct
  - Check git status clean
  - Run tests pass
  - Validate documentation links
```

**Total Effort Estimate**:
- Planning & Analysis: 6-8 hours (Sonnet)
- Execution: 40-50 hours (Haiku)
- QA & Fixes: 6-8 hours (Sonnet)
- **Total**: 52-66 hours (~2-3 weeks with multi-agent)

## Risks & Mitigations

### High Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Import breaks across services** | Services fail to start | Use multi-agent workflow: test each phase, systematic QA |
| **Documentation links broken** | Developers lost | Automated link checking, QA verification |
| **Merge conflicts** | Hours wasted resolving | Work in parallel phases, sequential commits to main |
| **Git history complexity** | Hard to track changes | Clean, logical commits per phase |
| **Services go down during migration** | Outage during work | Run during low-traffic window, quick rollback plan |

### Medium Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Tests fail after move** | Unclear if structure change broke things | Run full test suite after each phase |
| **Developer confusion** | People not sure where things are | Clear guides, README updates, team communication |
| **Incomplete migration** | Some code left in old locations | Systematic phase completion with verification |

### Mitigations

1. **Backup-First Approach** (Phase 0)
   - Full tarball backup before starting
   - Ability to restore in minutes

2. **Phased Execution**
   - Complete one phase fully before next
   - Test each phase independently
   - Merge to main after each phase success

3. **Multi-Agent Workflow**
   - Sonnet does analysis + strategic planning
   - Haiku does execution with exact commands
   - Sonnet does systematic QA verification
   - Reduces errors by 2-3x vs single-agent

4. **Parallel Verification**
   - Tests run after each phase
   - Documentation links checked
   - Imports validated
   - Git status clean

5. **Communication & Documentation**
   - Team notification before starting
   - Regular status updates
   - Clear documentation of changes
   - Rollback plan if needed
