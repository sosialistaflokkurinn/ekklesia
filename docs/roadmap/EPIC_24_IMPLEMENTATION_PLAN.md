# Epic #24: Election Management (Admin) - Implementation Plan

**Epic:** [#24](https://github.com/sosialistaflokkurinn/ekklesia/issues/24)  
**Total Tasks:** 15 issues (#71-#85)  
**Estimated Effort:** 40h (10h + 12h + 8h + 10h weekly breakdown)  
**Team Capacity:** 20h/week ‚Üí 4-week delivery  
**Status:** Foundation Ready (Phase 1 unblocked)

---

## üì¶ Epic Dependencies

### Depends On:
- ‚úÖ **Epic #1** (Platform Bootstrap) - 85% complete, infrastructure operational
  - GCP project, Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Firebase Auth all working
- ‚úÖ **Epic #2** (Member Core) - Authentication and profiles working
  - Firebase Auth integration complete, member verification operational

### Independent Of:
- ‚ö™ **Epic #3a** (Elections - Member Experience) - Can be implemented in parallel
  - User stories #25, #26, #27 (member-facing features) not required for admin API

### Enables:
- **Epic #3a completion** - Once elections can be created dynamically via admin API, members can view/vote on them
- **Future election types** - Foundation supports multiple election formats beyond Pr√≥funarkosning

## üéØ Critical Path

The longest sequential dependency chain is:

```
Week 1: #83 (RBAC) + #80/#81 (schemas) [4h + 6h = 10h dev, 6h elapsed parallel]
          ‚Üì              ‚Üì
Week 2:  #84 (migration) [needs #81] (3h)
          ‚Üì
Week 2:  #71 (create) [needs #81, #83, #84] (3h)
          ‚Üì
Week 2:  #72 (edit) [needs #71] (2h)
          ‚Üì
Week 2:  #73 (publish) [needs #71, #72, #84] (2h)
          ‚Üì
Week 3:  #74 (close) [needs #73] (1.5h)
          ‚Üì
Week 3:  #76 (archive) [needs #74] (1.5h)
          ‚Üì
Week 4:  #78 (list) [needs #71-#77] (3h)
          ‚Üì
Week 4:  #85 (tests) [needs all] (7h)
```

**Critical path:** 10 sequential tasks  
**Critical path time:** 6h (Week 1 elapsed) + 3h + 3h + 2h + 2h + 1.5h + 1.5h + 3h + 7h = **29h**  
**Parallel paths:** #75 (Pause/Resume) and #77 (Delete) can run alongside #74/#76 in Week 3  
**Total with buffer:** 40h (29h critical + 11h parallel/buffer = 38% buffer)

## üö® Risk Assessment

### üî¥ HIGH RISK

1. **RBAC not completed first (#83)**
   - **Risk:** If developers implement endpoints before RBAC is ready, security becomes afterthought
   - **Impact:** Security debt, potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities
   - **Mitigation:** Make #83 first priority (Critical), block all endpoint work until complete

2. **Schema not finalized (#80, #81)**
   - **Risk:** Cannot implement #71 (create election) without knowing database structure
   - **Impact:** Rework, wasted effort if schema changes mid-implementation
   - **Mitigation:** Complete schema design in Week 1 (parallel with #83)

### üü° MEDIUM RISK

3. **Migration not tested (#84)**
   - **Risk:** Hardcoded election may conflict with database-driven elections
   - **Impact:** E2E voting flow breaks after migration
   - **Mitigation:** Dedicated testing phase in #84, run E2E flow before/after

4. **No comprehensive E2E testing (#85)**
   - **Risk:** Individual tests pass but lifecycle has integration bugs
   - **Impact:** Production bugs, edge cases not caught
   - **Mitigation:** Dedicated Week 4 for testing, 44 RBAC tests + error scenarios

### üü¢ LOW RISK

5. **Time estimates optimistic**
   - **Risk:** 27h nominal may become 40h with reviews/debugging
   - **Impact:** Delivery delay by 1-2 weeks
   - **Mitigation:** 25% buffer built into plan (40h total, 4-week timeline)

---

## üé¨ Immediate Next Actions

### This Week:
1. **Schedule RBAC policy review meeting** (finalize role permissions matrix)
2. **Kick off schema design sessions** for #80 (eligibility) and #81 (ballot)
3. **Assign developers** to Week 1 tasks:
   - Developer A: #83 (RBAC) - critical path
   - Developer B: #80, #81 (schemas) - parallel work
   - Developer C: #82 (audit logging) - parallel work

### Week 1 Start:
1. **Implement #83 (RBAC middleware)** - **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
2. **Finalize #80, #81 (schemas)** - foundation work
3. **Document #82 (audit format)** - operational readiness

**Ready to start NOW:** #80, #81, #82, #83 (all unblocked) üöÄ
