---

## Recovery Process

### Step 1: Identified Dangling Commits ✅
```bash
git fsck --lost-found 2>/dev/null | grep "dangling commit"
```

**Found:** 6 dangling commits containing lost work
- `110598d6f5ba50e392a31b9c28a49db34cbaf8c5` - .code-rules cleanup
- `2e1b0237c7c82ae89369fc4762d7911ffee38727` - WIP stash merge
- `0a2b26c0021635c84f984f900fae976b8aa3acc4` - WIP stash with deletions
- `1f3de009831e7ada0fe7102dd32ace80b03ca657` - **Primary recovery source** ✅
- `4c560ee218036f3c3300f25b27640593e122f7ad` - Documentation edit
- `ba797855541fbdd6e742c6dff9fcf672b6ae54d9` - .code-rules cleanup

### Step 2: Created Recovery Branches ✅
Created temporary branches from each dangling commit for safe examination:
```
recovery/commit-1 through recovery/commit-6
```

### Step 3: Analyzed Each Branch ✅
Examined differences to identify which branches contained valuable work.

**Analysis Results:**
- ✅ `recovery/commit-4` (1f3de00): **23 audit/documentation files** → APPLIED
- ✅ `recovery/commit-5` (4c560ee): **documentation edits** → ANALYZED (security risk identified)
- ⚠️ `recovery/commit-1,2,3,6`: WIP/duplicate → SKIPPED

### Step 4: Extracted Files ✅
Manually extracted valuable files using `git checkout` to handle conflicts:

**Python Audit Scripts (6 files):**
- `audit-documentation.py`
- `audit-documentation-detailed.py`
- `fix-documentation.py`
- `remediation-summary.py`
- `validate-links.py`
- `validate_documentation_map.py`

**Audit Reports (6 files):**
- `AUDIT_CODE_DOCUMENTATION_2025-10-20.json`
- `AUDIT_CODE_DOCUMENTATION_DETAILED_2025-10-20.json`
- `AUDIT_SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-20.txt`
- `BROKEN_EXAMPLES_LIST.json`
- `MISSING_FILES_CATEGORIZED.json`
- `REMEDIATION_SUMMARY_2025-10-20.json`

**Documentation (10 files):**
- Architecture & design docs (3 files)
- Audit reports & reviews (4 files)
- Setup guides (1 file)
- Maintenance docs (2 files)

### Step 5: Reorganized to Proper Locations ✅
Moved all files to their correct subdirectories following PR #29 structure:

| Files | Destination | Reason |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Audit scripts | `scripts/` | Operational tools |
| Audit reports | `docs/audits/` | Audit findings |
| Architecture docs | `docs/design/` | Design reference |
| Deployment guide | `docs/setup/` | Setup procedures |
| Operational docs | `docs/maintenance/` | Maintenance procedures |
| Usage context | `docs/guides/` | Reference guides |

### Step 6: Staged and Committed ✅
```bash
git add -f scripts/ docs/design/ARCHITECTURE* ...
git commit -m "recover: restore lost work from PR #34 merge dangling commits"
```

**Commit:** `7af86ed` (HEAD -> main)  
**Pre-commit checks:** ✅ All passed

### Step 7: Cleaned Up ✅
Deleted all temporary recovery branches:
```bash
git branch -D recovery/commit-{1..6}
```

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Secured Against Data Leakage
During recovery of `recovery/commit-5`, detected plaintext credentials in `HISTORY_PURGE_PLAN.md`:
- Database password fragment
- Admin password

**Action Taken:** Did NOT apply this commit to prevent re-introducing secrets that should have been removed.

### ✅ Pre-commit Checks Passed
All security checks passed before final commit:
- ✅ Political identity check
- ✅ Secret scanning
- ✅ Commit message validation

---

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ All 22 files present in working directory
- ✅ All files in correct subdirectories
- ✅ Total lines match recovery statistics (6,664)
- ✅ Git status clean (nothing to commit)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks passed
- ✅ Recovery commit created (7af86ed)
- ✅ Recovery branches cleaned up
- ✅ No dangling recovery artifacts remaining

---

## What's Next

### For Team Communication:
1. Review the recovered files in the repository
2. Verify all edits are present and correct
3. Share recovery documentation with team (in docs/MERGE_RECOVERY_GUIDE.md)

### For Future Prevention:
See **Prevention Strategies** in `docs/MERGE_RECOVERY_GUIDE.md`:
1. Regular git reflog reviews
2. Pre-rebase stash documentation
3. Backup branches before major operations
4. Team communication during complex merges
5. Using `--no-ff` merge strategy
6. Pre-merge validation scripts
7. Post-merge verification checklist

### Repository State:
```
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 5 commits.
