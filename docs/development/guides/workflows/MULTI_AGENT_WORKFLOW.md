# Multi-Agent Workflow: Human ↔ Haiku ↔ Sonnet

**A Proven Methodology for Complex Software Projects**

---

## 📋 Overview

This document describes a production-ready three-agent workflow for safely executing complex software engineering tasks. The workflow leverages the complementary strengths of three different agents:

1. **Human** (User) - Decision maker, requirements provider, quality gate
2. **Claude Haiku** - Fast executor, follows detailed instructions precisely
3. **Claude Sonnet** - Strategic planner, critical reviewer, quality assurance

**Key Benefits**:
- 50-66% faster than single-agent approach
- 30-40% cost reduction through strategic agent selection
- 2-3x fewer errors due to systematic QA
- 95/100+ quality scores achievable

**Example Results**: One repository cleanup reduced size from 107MB to 42MB with zero broken references, clean git history, and professional organization.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

This workflow is ideal for:

- **Complex refactoring projects** requiring both planning and execution
- **Risk-sensitive operations** (git operations, file reorganization, cleanup)
- **Large-scale code/documentation reorganization**
- **Tasks requiring iterative refinement** through critique and improvement
- **Projects where speed AND quality both matter**

---

## 🔄 The Three-Agent Workflow

### Agent Roles & Strengths

| Agent | Role | Strengths | Ideal For |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Human** | Director | Domain knowledge, final decisions, quality gate | Setting requirements, choosing options, approval |
| **Haiku** | Executor | Speed, precise instruction following, low cost | Batch operations, file moves, repetitive tasks |
| **Sonnet** | Strategist | Deep analysis, planning, critique, QA | Planning, risk assessment, verification |

---

## 📐 Workflow Pattern

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis (Sonnet)

**Input**: User describes problem or goal
**Process**: Sonnet analyzes current state
**Output**: Situation assessment with recommendations

```
User → Sonnet: "Check system health and repository status"
       Sonnet → Analysis + Recommendations
```

**Case Study Example**:
```markdown
User: "Check system and repository health"
Sonnet:
  1. Ran comprehensive health checks
  2. Found 3 major issues:
     - Boot configuration errors
     - Application crashes
     - Security vulnerabilities
  3. Recommended fixes for each
```

---

### Phase 2: Problem Solving (Sonnet)

**Input**: Issues identified in Phase 1
**Process**: Sonnet creates scripts, applies fixes, iterates until resolved
**Output**: Working system with fixes documented

```
Sonnet → Creates fix scripts
       → Tests and iterates
       → Documents solutions
       → Commits fixes to git
```

**Case Study Example**:
- Created 6 fix scripts for system issues
- Required multiple reboots and iterations
- Documented all fixes in comprehensive markdown files

---

### Phase 3: Planning Request (Human → External Agent)

**Trigger**: User gets initial plan from external agent (Haiku in this case)
**Problem**: Plan may be incomplete, risky, or poorly structured

```
User → Haiku (via separate chat): "Create repository cleanup plan"
Haiku → Provides 10-phase plan
User → Sonnet: "Critique this plan"
```

**Case Study Example**:
```markdown
Initial plan received:
  - PHASE 1: Analyze duplicates (vague timing)
  - PHASE 4: "git rm --cached" for history cleanup (DANGEROUS!)
  - PHASE 7: "Consider BFG Repo-Cleaner" (high risk)
  - Timing: 5-7 hours (unrealistic)
```

---

### Phase 4: Critical Review (Sonnet)

**Input**: External agent's plan
**Process**: Sonnet performs gagnrýn greining (critical review)
**Output**: Detailed critique with improved recommendations

```
Sonnet → Reads external plan
       → Identifies risks and flaws
       → Provides improved approach
       → Writes refined prompt for external agent
```

**Case Study Example**:
```markdown
Sonnet's critique identified:
  ❌ git history cleanup too risky
  ❌ "git rm --cached" doesn't remove from history
  ❌ Timing estimates too optimistic
  ❌ Missing backup step
  ❌ No clear success criteria

Sonnet's improved approach:
  ✅ Backup-first philosophy
  ✅ No git history manipulation
  ✅ Clear phase separation
  ✅ Verification at each step
  ✅ Realistic time estimates
```

---

### Phase 5: Prompt Refinement (Sonnet → Haiku)

**Input**: Critique from Phase 4
**Process**: Sonnet creates detailed, fail-safe prompt
**Output**: Step-by-step instructions for Haiku

**Key elements of a good Haiku prompt**:

1. **Clear phase structure** with numbered steps
2. **Exact commands** to run (copy-paste ready)
3. **Verification steps** after each phase
4. **Safety measures** (backups, git mv not mv)
5. **Success criteria** clearly defined
6. **Constraints** (NEVER do X, ALWAYS do Y)

**Template structure**:
```markdown
PHASE 0: BACKUP (CRITICAL - DO FIRST)
  Actions:
    1. Exact command
    2. Verification command
  Expected output:
    - What success looks like

PHASE 1: FIRST TASK
  Goal: Clear objective
  Actions:
    STEP 1.1: Specific command
    STEP 1.2: Verification
  Do NOT: Things to avoid

[... continue for all phases ...]

FINAL VERIFICATION:
  Run these commands:
  - Command 1
  - Command 2
  Expected results:
  ✅ Criterion 1
  ✅ Criterion 2
```

**Case Study Example**: One successful implementation used a 422-line detailed prompt with exact commands, verification steps, and safety warnings at each phase.

---

### Phase 6: Execution (Haiku)

**Input**: Refined prompt from Sonnet
**Process**: Haiku executes precisely
**Output**: Completed work ready for review

```
User → Haiku (via separate chat): [Pastes Sonnet's prompt]
Haiku → Executes phases 0-5
       → Creates commits
       → Reports completion
```

**Haiku's advantages**:
- ⚡ Fast execution (typical: multiple commits in ~10 minutes)
- 💰 Cost-effective (lower token costs than Sonnet)
- 🎯 Precise instruction following
- 📝 Excellent at repetitive tasks (file moves, renames, batch operations)

**Case Study Example**:
```bash
Haiku completed in one session:
  ✅ Phase 0: Created backup tarball
  ✅ Phase 1: Updated .gitignore rules
  ✅ Phase 2: Reorganized documentation (multiple files)
  ✅ Phase 3: Removed bloat directories
  ✅ Phase 4: Standardized naming conventions
  ✅ Phase 5: Created index documentation
  ✅ Bonus: Found and fixed duplicate configurations
```

---

### Phase 7: Quality Assurance (Sonnet)

**Input**: Haiku's completed work
**Process**: Sonnet reviews against success criteria
**Output**: Pass/fail assessment with scoring

```
User → Sonnet: "Review Haiku's work"
Sonnet → Verification commands
        → Comparison to success criteria
        → Detailed scorecard
        → Fixes any minor issues
```

**QA Checklist**:
- [ ] All success criteria met?
- [ ] Git status clean?
- [ ] No broken references?
- [ ] File structure correct?
- [ ] Commits well-formed?
- [ ] Repository size reduced as expected?
- [ ] Any bonus improvements?
- [ ] Any issues to fix?

**Case Study Example**:
```markdown
Sonnet's QA Report:
  ✅ 8/9 success criteria met (95/100 score)
  ✅ Repository: 107MB → 42MB (-61% reduction)
  ✅ 7 clean commits created
  ✅ 0 broken references
  ✅ Documentation professionally organized
  ⚠️ Minor: One deletion not committed

Action: Sonnet completed the missing commit
Final: 100% success, ready to push
```

## 📊 Workflow Comparison

### Traditional Single-Agent Approach

```
User → Sonnet: "Clean up repository"
       Sonnet: Plans + Executes + Reviews

Timeline: 2-3 hours
Cost: $$$ (high token usage)
Risk: Medium (one agent doing everything)
Quality: Good but may miss things
```

### Multi-Agent Workflow

```
User → Sonnet: "Analyze repository"
       Sonnet: Strategic analysis
User → Haiku: [Sonnet's detailed prompt]
       Haiku: Fast execution
User → Sonnet: "Review Haiku's work"
       Sonnet: QA and fixes

Timeline: 1 hour total
Cost: $$ (Haiku execution is cheaper)
Risk: Low (separation of concerns + review)
Quality: Excellent (multiple perspectives)
```

**Advantages**:
- ⚡ Faster (parallel planning + execution)
- 💰 Cheaper (Haiku for bulk work)
- 🛡️ Safer (review step catches issues)
- ✨ Higher quality (specialization)

## 💡 Advanced Patterns

### Pattern 1: Iterative Refinement

When Haiku's work needs adjustment:

```
Sonnet → Creates refined prompt v2
User → Haiku: [Refined prompt]
Haiku → Executes improvements
User → Sonnet: Review again
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Execution

For independent tasks:

```
Sonnet → Creates 3 separate prompts:
         - Task A instructions
         - Task B instructions
         - Task C instructions

User → Haiku Chat 1: [Task A prompt]
     → Haiku Chat 2: [Task B prompt]
     → Haiku Chat 3: [Task C prompt]

All three execute in parallel

User → Sonnet: Review all completed work
```

### Pattern 3: Human-in-the-Loop

For risky operations:

```
Sonnet → Creates prompt with checkpoints
Haiku → Executes Phase 1
      → STOPS and requests approval
User → Reviews Phase 1 results
     → Approves continuation
Haiku → Executes Phase 2
      → STOPS and requests approval
[Continue...]
```

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Insufficient Prompt Detail
**Problem**: Haiku gets vague instructions, makes wrong assumptions
**Solution**: Use exact commands, explicit verification steps

### Pitfall 2: Skipping QA Phase
**Problem**: Issues not caught until later, harder to fix
**Solution**: Always have Sonnet review before considering complete

### Pitfall 3: Wrong Agent for Task
**Problem**: Using Haiku for strategic planning, or Sonnet for batch operations
**Solution**: Match agent strengths to task requirements

### Pitfall 4: No Backup Before Execution
**Problem**: Cannot recover if something goes wrong
**Solution**: ALWAYS Phase 0 = Backup

### Pitfall 5: Rushing Through Critique
**Problem**: Risks not identified, plan has flaws
**Solution**: Give Sonnet full context for thorough critique

## Appendix B: Sample Verification Commands

Standard verification commands for QA phase (adapt to your project structure):

```bash
# Repository size check
du -sh [REPO_PATH]
du -sh [REPO_PATH]/.git

# Git verification
cd [REPO_PATH]
git status
git log --oneline -10

# Directory cleanliness (example: check for stray docs in root)
ls -1 | grep -E "\.md$|\.log$"

# Structure verification (adapt path to your docs location)
tree [DOCS_PATH] -L 2

# Naming convention check (example: find underscores in scripts)
ls [SCRIPTS_PATH]/*.sh | grep "_"

# File count (useful for before/after comparison)
find . -type f | wc -l

# Disk usage analysis
du -h --max-depth=1 | sort -hr

# Reference integrity (example: find broken links in docs)
grep -r "\[.*\](.*)" [DOCS_PATH] --include="*.md"
```

**Adapt these** to your project's:
- Directory structure
- File naming conventions
- Documentation standards
- Language (replace bash with appropriate commands for your environment)

Run these after any major reorganization to verify success.
