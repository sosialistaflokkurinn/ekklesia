---

## ✅ Reality Check: Are They Really Missing?

Let's verify - **MOST ARE ACTUALLY THERE**:

```bash
# Check if they exist after the merge
cd /home/gudro/Development/projects/ekklesia

# Documentation files - check if they exist
find . -name "ADMIN_ALERTS.md"  # Should be at docs/development/guides/ADMIN_ALERTS.md
find . -name "AUDIT_LOGGING.md"  # Should be at docs/development/guides/AUDIT_LOGGING.md

# Module files
find . -name "server.js"          # Should be at tools/legacy/server.js
find . -name "audit-mfa.js"       # Should be at members/scripts/audit-mfa.js

# Special guides
find . -name "GITHUB_INTEGRATION_GUIDELINES.md"
```

### What's Actually Happening:

These files **exist** but:
1. ✅ They're in the correct new locations (PR #29 reorganized them)
2. ✅ The merge was successful
3. ❓ But YOUR EDITS to them might not have made it through
4. 📍 Location: Now in dangling commits

---

## 🔍 Scenario: Finding Your Lost Edits

### Scenario 1: You Edited a Doc Before Merge

**Your situation:**
```
Before PR #29:
  └─ docs/ADMIN_ALERTS.md (you edited it)

After PR #29:
  └─ docs/development/guides/ADMIN_ALERTS.md (file moved)

During PR #34 rebase:
  - Git saw: docs/ADMIN_ALERTS.md (your edit) vs docs/development/guides/ADMIN_ALERTS.md (new location)
  - Conflict!
  - You resolved as: accept their version (keep move)
  - Result: Your edits lost in dangling commit
```

**Recovery:**
```bash
# 1. Examine dangling commits to find your edits
git show --stat 110598d6f5ba50e392a31b9c28a49db34cbaf8c5
# Look for: "docs/ADMIN_ALERTS.md" or similar at old path

# 2. View the specific diff
git show 110598d6f5ba50e392a31b9c28a49db34cbaf8c5 -- docs/ADMIN_ALERTS.md

# 3. Create recovery branch
git branch recovery/admin-alerts 110598d6f5ba50e392a31b9c28a49db34cbaf8c5

# 4. Check out the file
git checkout recovery/admin-alerts -- docs/ADMIN_ALERTS.md

# 5. Review your edits
less docs/ADMIN_ALERTS.md

# 6. Move to correct location and merge with current version
cp docs/ADMIN_ALERTS.md docs/development/guides/ADMIN_ALERTS.md

# 7. Review the merged result
git diff docs/development/guides/ADMIN_ALERTS.md

# 8. If good, stage it
git add docs/development/guides/ADMIN_ALERTS.md

# 9. Commit
git commit -m "recover: restore edits to ADMIN_ALERTS.md"
```

---

### Scenario 2: You Added a New NPM Script

**Your situation:**
```
You created: members/scripts/new-audit-script.js (uncommitted)

During merge:
  - Rebase happened
  - Your new file wasn't in PR #34 base
  - File ended up in dangling commit

Recovery:
  - Check if file exists: find . -name "new-audit-script.js"
  - If not found: recover from dangling commit
  - If found but wrong: recover your version
```

**Recovery:**
```bash
# 1. Search for the file in dangling commits
for commit in $(git fsck --lost-found 2>/dev/null | grep "dangling commit" | awk '{print $3}'); do
  if git show $commit:members/scripts/new-audit-script.js 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "Found in commit $commit"
  fi
done

# 2. Create recovery branch from that commit
git branch recovery/npm-scripts FOUND_COMMIT_HASH

# 3. Extract the file
git checkout recovery/npm-scripts -- members/scripts/

# 4. Review what you got
ls -la members/scripts/new-audit-script.js
git diff --cached members/scripts/

# 5. Commit
git add members/scripts/
git commit -m "recover: restore NPM script files"
```

---

### Scenario 3: Multiple Files in Same Dangling Commit

**Your situation:**
```
One dangling commit has multiple files you need:
  - docs/development/guides/OAUTH_TROUBLESHOOTING.md (edits)
  - members/scripts/audit-mfa.js (new file)
  - scripts/get-secret.sh (modified)

Recovery:
  - Recover entire commit as branch
  - Selectively cherry-pick what you need
```

**Recovery:**
```bash
# 1. Create recovery branch for ALL files in that commit
git branch recovery/multi-file 2e1b0237c7c82ae89369fc4762d7911ffee38727

# 2. See what's in there
git diff main recovery/multi-file --stat

# 3. Review specific files
git diff main recovery/multi-file -- docs/development/guides/OAUTH_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
git diff main recovery/multi-file -- members/scripts/audit-mfa.js
git diff main recovery/multi-file -- scripts/get-secret.sh

# 4. Option A: Cherry-pick entire commit
git cherry-pick recovery/multi-file
# If conflicts: resolve, then git cherry-pick --continue

# 4. Option B: Cherry-pick specific files
git checkout recovery/multi-file -- docs/development/guides/OAUTH_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
git checkout recovery/multi-file -- members/scripts/audit-mfa.js
git checkout recovery/multi-file -- scripts/get-secret.sh
git add .
git commit -m "recover: restore multiple files from merge recovery"
```

---

## 🎯 Most Likely Scenario: Your Actual Situation

Based on the patterns, this is what probably happened:

```
Before Merge (You had uncommitted):
├─ docs/AUDIT_2025-10-20.md (edits)
├─ docs/CRITICAL_REVIEW_RESPONSE.md (new content)
├─ audit-documentation-detailed.py (new script)
├─ validate-links.py (modifications)
└─ validate_documentation_map.py (modifications)

PR #29 Already Merged (Moved files):
├─ docs/AUDIT_2025-10-20.md → docs/audits/AUDIT_2025-10-20.md
├─ docs/CRITICAL_REVIEW_RESPONSE.md → docs/audits/reviews/CRITICAL_REVIEW_RESPONSE.md
├─ audit-documentation-detailed.py → docs/audits/audit-documentation-detailed.py
├─ validate-links.py → docs/audits/validate-links.py
└─ validate_documentation_map.py → docs/audits/validate_documentation_map.py

During PR #34 Rebase (12 commits became 1):
├─ Git tried to apply commits with old paths
├─ Conflicts detected (file paths don't match)
├─ You resolved: "accept main's version" (keep moves)
├─ Result: Your edits in dangling commit

Outcome (After Merge):
├─ Files ARE in main (at new locations)
├─ But YOUR EDITS are in dangling commits
├─ Files have original PR #29 content, not your updates
└─ YOUR WORK: in dangling commits (recoverable)
```

## �� Recovery Action Plan for Your Case

### Step 1: Identify Your Lost Commits

```bash
# Most likely: these 3 dangling commits have your work
git show --stat 110598d6f5ba50e392a31b9c28a49db34cbaf8c5
git show --stat 2e1b0237c7c82ae89369fc4762d7911ffee38727
git show --stat 0a2b26c0021635c84f984f900fae976b8aa3acc4

# Look for patterns:
# - Your file paths (old locations: docs/AUDIT, docs/CRITICAL, validate*.py)
# - Your commit messages (if any)
# - Your changes patterns
```

### Step 2: Create Recovery Branches

```bash
git branch recovery/audit-files 110598d6f5ba50e392a31b9c28a49db34cbaf8c5
git branch recovery/scripts-1 2e1b0237c7c82ae89369fc4762d7911ffee38727
git branch recovery/scripts-2 0a2b26c0021635c84f984f900fae976b8aa3acc4
```

### Step 3: Review Each Branch

```bash
# Check audit files recovery
git checkout recovery/audit-files
git ls-files | grep -i audit
git diff main -- docs/AUDIT*.md
git diff main -- docs/CRITICAL*.md

# Check script recovery
git checkout recovery/scripts-1
git ls-files | grep "validate"
git ls-files | grep "\.py$"

# Back to main
git checkout main
```

### Step 4: Extract Your Edits

```bash
# Only recover if changes are BETTER than current
# If current version in main is fine, skip this

# Example: Recover audit files
git checkout recovery/audit-files -- docs/

# Move to correct location
mkdir -p docs/audits/reviews
cp docs/AUDIT*.md docs/audits/ 2>/dev/null
cp docs/CRITICAL_REVIEW_RESPONSE.md docs/audits/reviews/ 2>/dev/null
rm -rf docs/AUDIT*.md docs/CRITICAL*.md 2>/dev/null

# Review what you're adding
git status
git diff --cached docs/audits/

# If good, commit
git add docs/audits/
git commit -m "recover: restore lost edits to audit documentation"
```

### Step 5: Verify

```bash
# Check files are in correct locations
ls -la docs/audits/
ls -la docs/audits/reviews/

# Verify they have your edits
grep "your-identifier" docs/audits/AUDIT_2025-10-20.md
# Should show your changes

# Check status
git status  # should be clean
git log --oneline -3  # should show recovery commit
```

### Step 6: Cleanup

```bash
# Delete recovery branches (you're confident now)
git branch -D recovery/audit-files
git branch -D recovery/scripts-1
git branch -D recovery/scripts-2

# Push to remote
git push origin main

# Verify remote has recovery commit
git log --oneline -3
git branch -r  # should show origin/main with recovery commit
```

## 🚨 Warning Signs (If Something's Wrong)

### ⚠️ "I see conflicts after cherry-pick"
→ This means the file changed in ways that don't merge automatically  
→ Solution: Resolve conflicts manually, then `git add .` + `git cherry-pick --continue`

### ⚠️ "File I recovered doesn't have my edits"
→ You picked wrong dangling commit  
→ Solution: Go back (`git reset --hard HEAD~1`) and try different commit

### ⚠️ "I can't find a file I know I edited"
→ File might be in a different dangling commit  
→ Solution: Check all 6 dangling commits systematically

### ⚠️ "Main branch has weird state"
→ You might have interrupted a cherry-pick  
→ Solution: `git cherry-pick --abort`, start over from main

---

## ✅ Success Verification

Run these to confirm recovery worked:

```bash
# 1. No uncommitted changes
git status
# Expected: "working tree clean"

# 2. Your files are in right location
ls -la docs/audits/  # should have your files
ls -la docs/development/guides/  # should have guides
ls -la scripts/      # should have scripts

# 3. Your edits are there (sample check)
grep "your-unique-content" docs/audits/AUDIT_2025-10-20.md
# Expected: finds your edits

# 4. Recent commits include recovery
git log --oneline -5
# Expected: shows recovery commit

# 5. Can push without issues
git push origin main --dry-run
# Expected: no errors
```

## 🎓 What You've Learned

1. **Git never loses data** - It's in the object database for 30 days
2. **Dangling commits are safety nets** - Git's way of saying "you might need this"
3. **File reorganization + uncommitted work = conflicts** - Very common pattern
4. **Recovery is a planned process** - Not scary, just systematic
5. **Prevention beats recovery** - Commit before complex merges next time
