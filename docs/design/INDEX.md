## ⚠️ Notice: Design Documentation Reorganization

**Effective**: November 9, 2025

Most design documents have been archived as they represent historical proposals and recommendations from October 2025. Current architecture is documented in:

- `/docs/architecture/` - Current system architecture
- `/docs/development/` - Current development guides

**Historical design documents** are available in:
- `/archive/old-design-docs/` - Phase 6 proposals, architecture recommendations, design system research

## 📖 Active Design Work

Currently, there is no active design work in this directory. New design proposals should be created here and moved to `/docs/architecture/` when finalized, or to `/archive/old-design-docs/` if superseded.
