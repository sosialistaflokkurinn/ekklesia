### I18N_POST_DEPLOYMENT_TEST_2025-11-05.md

**Archived:** 2025-11-24
**Reason:** Historical post-deployment test checklist

**Context:**
- **Date:** 2025-11-05
- **Deployment:** feature/epic-159-profile-and-admin-ui
- **Status:** Epic completed and merged (commit d0838b4)
- **Outcome:** Feature deployed to production successfully

**Why Archived:**
This was a post-deployment testing checklist created for Epic 159 (Profile & Admin UI with i18n and Sync Queue). The epic was successfully completed and merged via PR #171 on 2025-11-05.

While the checklist contained 61 testing items (all unchecked), the feature has been in production for 19 days without major issues, indicating the deployment was successful. These tests are no longer relevant as active TODOs since:

1. The feature is already deployed and stable
2. Any issues would have surfaced by now
3. Future i18n testing should use updated test protocols
4. The checklist was specific to that deployment

**Historical Value:**
This file is preserved as a reference for:
- Understanding what was tested during Epic 159 deployment
- Creating future i18n testing checklists
- Documenting the testing approach for profile/admin UI features

**Related:**
- Epic 159 PR: #171
- Commit: d0838b4 - "feat(epic-159): Complete Profile & Admin UI with i18n and Sync Queue"
- Deployment: feature/epic-159-profile-and-admin-ui
