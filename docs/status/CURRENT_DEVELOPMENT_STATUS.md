# Ekklesia Current Development Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** üü° Development Phase - Infrastructure Ready
**Current Phase:** 5 - Feature Development & Deployment Planning
**Target Completion:** November 2025

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Context

**Important:** Ekklesia is currently **under active development** and is NOT in production use.

### Infrastructure vs System Status
- **GCP Infrastructure**: Production-grade tools (ekklesia-prod-10-2025 project)
  - Using production Firebase, Cloud Run, Cloud SQL for development/testing
  - Production Kenni.is OAuth (real Icelandic eID authentication)
  - Reason: Kenni.is OAuth requires production setup for testing (no sandbox mode available)
- **System Status**: Development phase (unlisted URL, testing only)
  - URL is unlisted (not publicly shared with members)
  - Only developers know about and use the system for testing
  - All elections are test elections (non-binding)
  - Safe to experiment and iterate

**Important:** Anyone with an Icelandic eID *could* technically login if they knew the URL, but the URL is intentionally unlisted and only shared with developers.

**Target**: First production use planned when Phase 5 is complete and tested (TBD)

---

## Executive Summary

Ekklesia infrastructure is **stable and ready for development**. Phase 4 completed all foundational services:
- Elections Service MVP ‚úÖ
- Events Service MVP ‚úÖ
- Members Service with Firebase authentication ‚úÖ
- Cloud SQL PostgreSQL backend ‚úÖ
- Security hardening (8.5/10 rating) ‚úÖ
- Repository restructuring for scalability ‚úÖ

**Phase 5 is now ready to launch** with three parallel epics that will transform Ekklesia from infrastructure into a fully functional voting system.

## Development System Status

### Services (All Operational)

| Service | Status | Version | Last Deploy | Location |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Elections Service** | ‚úÖ Running | MVP | 2025-10-19 | `services/elections` |
| **Events Service** | ‚úÖ Running | MVP | 2025-10-19 | `services/events` |

|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Cloud Run** | ‚úÖ Deployed | 6 services: elections-service, events-service, handlekenniauth, healthz, syncmembers, verifymembership (europe-west2) |
| **Cloud SQL** | ‚úÖ Operational | PostgreSQL 15.1, 2 schemas (public, elections) |
| **Firebase Hosting** | ‚úÖ Live | Members frontend at https://ekklesia-prod-10-2025.web.app |
| **Cloud Storage** | ‚úÖ Configured | Audit logs and backups |
| **IAM & Security** | ‚úÖ Hardened | Service accounts, CORS restricted, Cache-Control headers |

### Database Schema (Verified)

```
‚îå‚îÄ public (Shared)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users (kn = kennitala/ID)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ voting_tokens (temporary auth)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sync_log (membership sync audit)
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ elections (Phase 5 Elections)

   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ questions (ballot questions)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ballots (cast votes - anon)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ results (aggregated results)
```
