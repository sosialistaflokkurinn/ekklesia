# Ekklesia Current Development Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-09
**Status:** 🟡 Development Phase - Active Feature Development
**Current Phase:** 5 - Feature Development & Deployment
**Target Completion:** November 2025

---

## ⚠️ Development Context

**Important:** Ekklesia is currently **under active development** and is NOT in production use.

### Infrastructure vs System Status
- **GCP Infrastructure**: Production-grade tools (ekklesia-prod-10-2025 project)
  - Using production Firebase, Cloud Run, Cloud SQL for development/testing
  - Production Kenni.is OAuth (real Icelandic eID authentication)
  - Reason: Kenni.is OAuth requires production setup for testing (no sandbox mode available)
- **System Status**: Development phase (unlisted URL, testing only)
  - URL is unlisted (not publicly shared with members)
  - Only developers know about and use the system for testing
  - All elections are test elections (non-binding)
  - Safe to experiment and iterate

**Important:** Anyone with an Icelandic eID *could* technically login if they knew the URL, but the URL is intentionally unlisted and only shared with developers.

**Target**: First production use planned when Phase 5 is complete and tested (TBD)

---

## Executive Summary

Ekklesia infrastructure is **stable and ready for development**. Phase 4 completed all foundational services:
- Elections Service MVP ✅
- Events Service MVP ✅
- Members Service with Firebase authentication ✅
- Cloud SQL PostgreSQL backend ✅
- Security hardening (8.5/10 rating) ✅
- Repository restructuring for scalability ✅

**Phase 5 is now ready to launch** with three parallel epics that will transform Ekklesia from infrastructure into a fully functional voting system.

## Recent Development Activity (Nov 1-9, 2025)

**Major Features & Infrastructure:**

- ✅ **Admin Elections API (Epic #24)** - 10 new REST endpoints with RBAC
  - `GET /api/admin/elections` - List elections with filters
  - `POST /api/admin/elections` - Create new election
  - `GET /api/admin/elections/:id` - Get single election details
  - `PATCH /api/admin/elections/:id` - Update election metadata
  - `POST /api/admin/elections/:id/open` - Publish election (draft → published)
  - `POST /api/admin/elections/:id/close` - Close voting
  - `POST /api/admin/elections/:id/hide` - Soft delete
  - `POST /api/admin/elections/:id/unhide` - Restore hidden election
  - `DELETE /api/admin/elections/:id` - Hard delete (superadmin only)
  - `GET /api/admin/elections/:id/results` - Get election results
  - **RBAC**: `election-manager` and `superadmin` roles
  - **Database**: Elections table with status flow (draft → published → closed → archived)
  - **Issues**: #192, #203, #204, #205, #206, #207, #208, #209, #210, #211

- ✅ **Member Sync Service Critical Bug Fixes**
  - **Bug 1**: Missing Firestore composite index for sync_queue queries
    - Fixed query in `bidirectional_sync.py:72` - removed created_at filter
    - Created composite index: source + sync_status + target + created_at
  - **Bug 2**: Incomplete queue marking when grouping changes by kennitala
    - Fixed tracking logic to mark ALL queue items (not just first N)
    - Added `kennitala_to_queue_ids` mapping
  - **Result**: 6 pending items from Nov 6 successfully processed
  - **Deployment**: Revision bidirectional-sync-00008-sef

- ✅ **Documentation Maintenance Automation** - 3-layer system
  - **Layer 1**: SessionStart hook with maintenance reminder
  - **Layer 2**: Git post-commit hook (`post-commit-reminder.sh`)
  - **Layer 3**: GitHub Actions workflow (weekly checks + issue creation)
  - **Scripts**: `check-docs-freshness.sh`, `install-git-hook.sh`
  - **Guide**: `DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE.md` (367 lines)
  - **Files Monitored**: CURRENT_DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md, USAGE_CONTEXT.md, OPERATIONAL_PROCEDURES.md, SESSION_START_REMINDER.md

**Security & PII Protection:**

- ✅ **LOCAL_ONLY_FILES.md Catalog** - Comprehensive gitignore documentation
  - Catalog of all local-only files (policy docs, PII, admin scripts)
  - Patterns documented: *KENNITALA*.md, *kennitala*.md, check-user-logins.js
  - SessionStart hook added: GITIGNORED FILES AWARENESS
  - Pre-commit safety check instructions
  - `git add -f` requires user approval

**Policy Session & Member Experience:**

- ✅ **Immigration Policy Session Features**
  - Policy session voting interface
  - Navigation tabs for election types (general, board, policy)
  - Mobile navigation drawer with election type tabs
  - Amendment vote card component

- ✅ **Project Structure Reorganization**
  - Separated `/elections/` area from members-area
  - Separated `/events/` area from members-area
  - Hub and spoke pattern: dashboard as central hub
  - Clean URL structure: `/elections/`, `/events/`, `/policy-session/`
  - Issues: #234, #235, #236, #237

**Documentation Validation:**

- ✅ Fixed 36 broken links across documentation
- ✅ Fixed 16 anchor reference warnings
- ✅ Archived 6 outdated documentation scripts
- ✅ Created `validate-all.sh` master validation script

**Total Commits Since 2025-10-27:** 30+ commits across multiple areas

## Development System Status

### Services (All Operational)

| Service | Status | Version | Last Deploy | Location |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Elections Service** | ✅ Running | MVP + Admin API | 2025-11-09 | `services/elections` |
| **Elections Admin API** | ✅ Running | v1.0 | 2025-11-09 | 10 endpoints (CRUD, lifecycle, results) |
| **Events Service** | ✅ Running | MVP | 2025-10-19 | `services/events` |
| **Members Service** | ✅ Running | Phase 4 | 2025-10-18 | Frontend: `apps/members-portal/`<br>Functions: `services/members/` |

| **Firebase Project** | ✅ Active | Config | 2025-10-15 | ekklesia-prod-10-2025 |

**Note on Members Service:** Unlike Elections and Events services, the Members Service is a hybrid architecture:
- **Frontend**: Static site hosted on Firebase Hosting (`apps/members-portal/`)
- **Backend**: Cloud Functions (handlekenniauth, syncmembers, verifymembership in `services/members/`)

### Infrastructure (All Verified)

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Cloud Run** | ✅ Deployed | 6 services: elections-service, events-service, handlekenniauth, healthz, syncmembers, verifymembership (europe-west2) |
| **Cloud Functions** | ✅ Deployed | bidirectional_sync (revision 00008-sef), sync_members, track_member_changes |
| **Cloud SQL** | ✅ Operational | PostgreSQL 15.1, 2 schemas (public, elections) |
| **Firestore** | ✅ Active | Members collection, sync_queue collection with composite index |
| **Firestore Indexes** | ✅ Created | Composite index (CICAgJjF9oIK): sync_queue on source+sync_status+target+created_at |
| **Firebase Hosting** | ✅ Live | Members frontend at https://ekklesia-prod-10-2025.web.app |
| **Cloud Storage** | ✅ Configured | Audit logs and backups |
| **IAM & Security** | ✅ Hardened | Service accounts, CORS restricted, Cache-Control headers |

### Database Schema (Verified)

```
┌─ public (Shared)
│  ├── users (kn = kennitala/ID)
