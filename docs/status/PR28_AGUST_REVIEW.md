## Questions for √Åg√∫st (If Any)

### No Outstanding Questions
√Åg√∫st's approval was unconditional with no change requests or questions.

## Phase 5 Considerations

### Current State
- PR #28 approved (Members service)
- Phase 5 branch exists (`feature/elections-design-and-ops-docs`)
- Phase 5 includes:
  - Events service implementation (5 commits)
  - Elections service implementation (complete)
  - Full S2S integration (Events ‚Üî Elections)
  - Test interface (voting UI)
  - Comprehensive documentation

### Decision Needed
**Should Phase 5 branch be merged as-is, or split into separate PRs?**

#### Option A: Single PR for Phase 5 (Current Branch)
**Pros**:
- Full voting system in one PR
- Shows complete integration story
- Already tested end-to-end
- All documentation updated together

**Cons**:
- Large PR (5 commits, 3000+ lines)
- Includes Members commits (duplicate if not rebased)
- Harder to review separately

#### Option B: Split into 2 PRs
**PR #1: Events Service**
- Rebase on main (after PR #28 merges)
- 5 commits with Events implementation only
- Independent review

**PR #2: Elections Service + Integration**
- Elections service implementation
- S2S integration
- Test interface
- Phase 5 documentation

**Pros**:
- Cleaner git history
- Easier review (smaller PRs)
- Independent service deployment

**Cons**:
- More coordination needed
- Integration testing split across PRs

## Recommendation

### Immediate: Merge PR #28
Use the comprehensive squash commit message in `PR28_SQUASH_COMMIT_MESSAGE.md`

### Next: Phase 5 Strategy Discussion
Ask √Åg√∫st:
> "PR #28 er sameina√∞! üéâ N√∫na er Phase 5 tilb√∫i√∞ (Events + Elections full integration).
> Viltu a√∞ √©g b√∫i til einn st√≥ran PR fyrir Phase 5, e√∞a skipti √æv√≠ √≠ tvo PRa (Events s√©r og Elections s√©r)?
> Phase 5 branch er tilb√∫inn me√∞ √∂llu - b√¶√∞i services eru deployed og tested."

**Translation**:
> "PR #28 is merged! üéâ Now Phase 5 is ready (Events + Elections full integration).
> Do you want me to create one big PR for Phase 5, or split it into two PRs (Events separate and Elections separate)?
> Phase 5 branch is ready with everything - both services are deployed and tested."
