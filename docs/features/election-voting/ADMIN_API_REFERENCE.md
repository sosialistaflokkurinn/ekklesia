## Overview

The Admin API provides complete control over the election lifecycle, from creation through results publication. All endpoints require Firebase authentication and role-based access control.

### Authentication

All requests must include a valid Firebase ID token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <firebase_id_token>
```

The token must contain one of the following roles in custom claims:
- `developer` - Full access to all endpoints
- `meeting_election_manager` - Create, manage, and publish elections
- `event_manager` - View elections and results (read-only)

### Response Format

All responses follow a consistent JSON format:

**Success Response (2xx)**:
```json
{
  "election": { /* election object */ },
  "message": "Human-readable success message",
  "correlation_id": "request-correlation-id"
}
```

**Error Response (4xx, 5xx)**:
```json
{
  "error": "ErrorType",
  "message": "Human-readable error message",
  "correlation_id": "request-correlation-id"
}
```

### Rate Limiting

- **Admin operations**: 100 requests per 10 seconds per user
- **Read operations**: 1000 requests per 10 seconds per user
- **Burst limit**: Returns 429 (Too Many Requests) when exceeded
