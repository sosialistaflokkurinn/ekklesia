# The Socialist Party's Voting System (`Kosningakerfi`)

**Proposal for the system's architecture**

**Document Type**: Macro View - System Architecture Overview
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: ✅ **Active - Primary Architectural Vision** (Events MVP Deployed Oct 9, 2025)

---

## System (`Kerfi`)

The voting system consists of three main components:

* **Members (`Meðlimir`)**
    * Member registry
    * Permissions (`Réttindi`) and attributes of members
    * Status of membership fees

* **Events (`Atburðir`)**
    * Election administration
    * Types of elections
    * Member permissions (`Réttindi`) for participation

* **Voting (`Kosning`)**
    * Securely records election results

---

## The System (`Kerfi`) and Its Components

* The **Member-system** (`Meðlima-kerfið`) manages permissions (`réttindi`) and members.
* The **Event-system** (`Atburða-kerfið`) manages election events and who can vote in which election, based on information from the **Members** (`Meðlimum`) system.
* The **Election-system** (`Kosninga-kerfið`) manages the actual voting process but has no direct connection to **Members** (`Meðlimi`) or **Events** (`Atburði`).

---

## Communication Flow: Part 1

1. Users log into the **Members** (`Meðlimi`) system.
2. They receive a JWT token that can be used on the **Members** (`Meðlimum`) and **Events** (`Atburðum`) systems.
3. The user is forwarded to the **Events** (`Atburði`) system.
4. They can view relevant elections, depending on the permissions (`réttindi`) defined in the JWT from **Members** (`Meðlimum`).
5. The user views ongoing elections in **Events** (`Atburðum`) and chooses to participate.
6. **Events** (`Atburðir`) sends a non-personally identifiable, single-use voting token to the **Elections** (`Kosningar`) system (Server-to-Server) and to the user.
7. The user is forwarded to the **Elections** (`Kosningar`) system.
8. The user uses their voting token and casts their vote.

---

## Communication Flow: Part 2

1. The user is sent back to **Events** (`Atburði`) after voting.
    * The voting token is now marked as "used" in the **Elections** (`Kosningum`) system and cannot be used again.
2. The user can repeat the process to answer more questions, as applicable and configured in **Events** (`Atburðum`).
3. A moderator decides when an election is finished.
    * Permissions (`Réttindi`) to close an election come from **Members** (`Meðlimum`) and are included in the JWT access token.
4. **Events** (`Atburðir`) fetches the results from **Elections** (`Kosningum`) (Server-to-Server).
5. **Events** (`Atburðir`) marks the election as finished within the **Elections** (`Kosningum`) system.
6. **Events** (`Atburðir`) displays the results to everyone with the appropriate permissions (`réttindi`).
    * This applies to everyone logged into **Events** (`Atburði`) with permissions to see the results.

---

## The Simple Version

* **Members (`Meðlimir`):** Handles login and issues an access token.
* **Events (`Atburðir`):** Determines permissions (`réttindi`), issues a voting token to logged-in members who are eligible to vote, and also forwards it to the **Elections** (`Kosninga`) system via a server-to-server (S2S) call.
* **Elections (`Kosningar`):** Receives votes and records them, linking them to a specific election defined in **Events** (`Atburðum`) (connected via ID). It has no information about members or the content of the elections.

---

## System Components and Work Chunks

### Members (`Meðlimir`)

* **Task:** Migrate from the old system to a new foundation.
* **Components:**
    * Database
    * REST API
    * Clients (website, app, etc.)
* **Simple initial setup:**
    * Members (`Meðlimir`)
    * Roles/Permissions (`Rullur/Réttindi`)
    * Membership fees (initially just a status marker, not a full management system)

### Elections (`Kosningar`)

* **Task:** Start with a very simple setup.
* **Scope:** One election, one question.

### Events (`Atburðir`)

* **Components:**
    * Database
    * REST API
    * Does not require a client.

---

## Auditing (`Endurskoðun`)

* **Events** (`Atburðir`) logs all voting requests.
    * Each time **Events** (`Atburðir`) creates a voting token, it is logged in a table (using a hash of the credentials).
    * It also logs which permissions (`réttindi`) were granted with the issued credentials.
* **Elections** (`Kosningar`) also maintains a list of voting tokens.
    * **Elections** (`Kosningar`) logs to a logging table in the same manner, both when the voting token is initially created and again when a member casts their vote.
* **Audit Trail:**
    * This arrangement makes it possible to audit all elections.
    * There is a clear and verifiable link between those who were issued permissions (`réttindi`) to participate, what those permissions were, and proof that those permissions were used in a specific election.

## Current Implementation Status (2025-10-09)

⚠️ **UPDATE (Oct 9, 2025)**: Events Service MVP deployed to production! All core voting infrastructure now operational.

**Decision**: Build custom Events and Voting services for election administration.

**See**: [archive/ekklesia-platform-evaluation/README.md](../archive/ekklesia-platform-evaluation/README.md) for Ekklesia evaluation details.

- ✅ Calculate and return results (S2S to Events via `/api/s2s/results`)
- ✅ Audit logging (no PII, token hash prefix only)

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/s2s/register-token` - Register voting token (S2S, API key)
- `GET /api/s2s/results` - Fetch results (S2S, API key)
- `POST /api/vote` - Submit ballot (public, token-based)
- `GET /api/token-status` - Check token validity (public, token-based)

## Architecture Evolution

### Original Vision (This Document)
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Server-to-server communication for voting tokens
- Complete separation between Members, Events, and Elections
- Non-personally identifiable voting tokens

### Current Implementation (Oct 2025)
- **Members**: ✅ Firebase custom tokens with kennitala claims (production, Oct 6)
- **Events (MVP)**: ✅ Deployed to production - election admin, token issuance (Oct 9)
- **Elections (MVP)**: ✅ Deployed to production - anonymous ballot recording (Oct 9)
- **Integration**: ✅ S2S communication complete - Events ↔ Elections (Phase 5, Oct 10)
- **Authentication**: Kenni.is national eID for authentication
- **Cost**: $7-13/month (Cloud SQL + Cloud Run, both services in production)

### Decommissioned Services (Oct 2025)
- **Portal Service**: ❌ Decommissioned from Cloud Run (Oct 8, 2025)
  - Reason: External Ekklesia Portal does not match election requirements
  - See: [archive/ekklesia-platform-evaluation/README.md](../archive/ekklesia-platform-evaluation/README.md)
