# The Socialist Party's Voting System (`Kosningakerfi`)

**Proposal for the system's architecture**

**Document Type**: Macro View - System Architecture Overview
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: ‚úÖ **Active - Primary Architectural Vision** (Restored Oct 7, 2025)

---

## System (`Kerfi`)

The voting system consists of three main components:

* **Members (`Me√∞limir`)**
    * Member registry
    * Permissions (`R√©ttindi`) and attributes of members
    * Status of membership fees

* **Events (`Atbur√∞ir`)**
    * Election administration
    * Types of elections
    * Member permissions (`R√©ttindi`) for participation

* **Voting (`Kosning`)**
    * Securely records election results

---

## The System (`Kerfi`) and Its Components

* The **Member-system** (`Me√∞lima-kerfi√∞`) manages permissions (`r√©ttindi`) and members.
* The **Event-system** (`Atbur√∞a-kerfi√∞`) manages election events and who can vote in which election, based on information from the **Members** (`Me√∞limum`) system.
* The **Election-system** (`Kosninga-kerfi√∞`) manages the actual voting process but has no direct connection to **Members** (`Me√∞limi`) or **Events** (`Atbur√∞i`).

---

## Communication Flow: Part 1

1. Users log into the **Members** (`Me√∞limi`) system.
2. They receive a JWT token that can be used on the **Members** (`Me√∞limum`) and **Events** (`Atbur√∞um`) systems.
3. The user is forwarded to the **Events** (`Atbur√∞i`) system.
4. They can view relevant elections, depending on the permissions (`r√©ttindi`) defined in the JWT from **Members** (`Me√∞limum`).
5. The user views ongoing elections in **Events** (`Atbur√∞um`) and chooses to participate.
6. **Events** (`Atbur√∞ir`) sends a non-personally identifiable, single-use voting token to the **Elections** (`Kosningar`) system (Server-to-Server) and to the user.
7. The user is forwarded to the **Elections** (`Kosningar`) system.
8. The user uses their voting token and casts their vote.

---

## Communication Flow: Part 2

1. The user is sent back to **Events** (`Atbur√∞i`) after voting.
    * The voting token is now marked as "used" in the **Elections** (`Kosningum`) system and cannot be used again.
2. The user can repeat the process to answer more questions, as applicable and configured in **Events** (`Atbur√∞um`).
3. A moderator decides when an election is finished.
    * Permissions (`R√©ttindi`) to close an election come from **Members** (`Me√∞limum`) and are included in the JWT access token.
4. **Events** (`Atbur√∞ir`) fetches the results from **Elections** (`Kosningum`) (Server-to-Server).
5. **Events** (`Atbur√∞ir`) marks the election as finished within the **Elections** (`Kosningum`) system.
6. **Events** (`Atbur√∞ir`) displays the results to everyone with the appropriate permissions (`r√©ttindi`).
    * This applies to everyone logged into **Events** (`Atbur√∞i`) with permissions to see the results.

---

## The Simple Version

* **Members (`Me√∞limir`):** Handles login and issues an access token.
* **Events (`Atbur√∞ir`):** Determines permissions (`r√©ttindi`), issues a voting token to logged-in members who are eligible to vote, and also forwards it to the **Elections** (`Kosninga`) system via a server-to-server (S2S) call.
* **Elections (`Kosningar`):** Receives votes and records them, linking them to a specific election defined in **Events** (`Atbur√∞um`) (connected via ID). It has no information about members or the content of the elections.

---

## System Components and Work Chunks

### Members (`Me√∞limir`)

* **Task:** Migrate from the old system to a new foundation.
* **Components:**
    * Database
    * REST API
    * Clients (website, app, etc.)
* **Simple initial setup:**
    * Members (`Me√∞limir`)
    * Roles/Permissions (`Rullur/R√©ttindi`)
    * Membership fees (initially just a status marker, not a full management system)

### Elections (`Kosningar`)

* **Task:** Start with a very simple setup.
* **Scope:** One election, one question.

### Events (`Atbur√∞ir`)

* **Components:**
    * Database
    * REST API
    * Does not require a client.

---

## Auditing (`Endursko√∞un`)

* **Events** (`Atbur√∞ir`) logs all voting requests.
    * Each time **Events** (`Atbur√∞ir`) creates a voting token, it is logged in a table (using a hash of the credentials).
    * It also logs which permissions (`r√©ttindi`) were granted with the issued credentials.
* **Elections** (`Kosningar`) also maintains a list of voting tokens.
    * **Elections** (`Kosningar`) logs to a logging table in the same manner, both when the voting token is initially created and again when a member casts their vote.
* **Audit Trail:**
    * This arrangement makes it possible to audit all elections.
    * There is a clear and verifiable link between those who were issued permissions (`r√©ttindi`) to participate, what those permissions were, and proof that those permissions were used in a specific election.

## Current Implementation Status (2025-10-08)

‚ö†Ô∏è **UPDATE (Oct 7-8, 2025)**: Ekklesia Platform evaluation completed and archived. Custom Events and Voting services designed. Portal service decommissioned.

**Decision**: Build custom Events and Voting services for election administration.

**See**: [archive/ekklesia-platform-evaluation/README.md](../archive/ekklesia-platform-evaluation/README.md) for Ekklesia evaluation details.
