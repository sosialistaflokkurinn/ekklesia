# Naming Clarification: Vision vs Ekklesia Platform

**Issue**: Confusion about how the original architectural vision maps to Ekklesia platform components
**Created**: 2025-10-07

---

## The Problem

The **original architectural vision** (SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md) uses these terms:

- **Members** (`Me√∞limir`) - Authentication and member registry
- **Events** (`Atbur√∞ir`) - Election administration
- **Elections** (`Kosningar`) - Voting system

The **Ekklesia platform** (open-source) has these components:

- **Ekklesia Portal** - Motion/proposition portal
- **Ekklesia Voting** - Pseudonymous voting

**Question**: How do these map to each other? Did we rename "Events" to "Portal"?

---

## The Answer: No Renaming Happened

We **did NOT rename** anything. We're using the **Ekklesia open-source platform** as-is, which has different terminology than our original vision.

### What Ekklesia Platform Actually Does

From the Ekklesia documentation:

**Ekklesia Portal**:
> "It provides the **motion portal** Web UI, the public API and administrative interface."

- **Purpose**: Manage motions/propositions (policy proposals, initiatives)
- **Features**: Submit proposals, debate, discuss, build consensus
- **NOT about**: Election administration or voting events
- **Think**: Proposition management, not election management

**Ekklesia Voting**:
> "Pseudonymous voting component of the Ekklesia e-democracy platform."

- **Purpose**: Cast votes on propositions/motions
- **Features**: Anonymous ballot casting, vote tallying
- **Integration**: Works with Portal to vote on motions

### The Ekklesia Platform Flow

```
User ‚Üí Ekklesia Portal ‚Üí View/Submit Motions ‚Üí Ekklesia Voting ‚Üí Cast Vote on Motion
```

This is **NOT** the same as our vision:

```
User ‚Üí Members ‚Üí Events (Election Admin) ‚Üí Elections (Voting) ‚Üí Cast Vote in Election
```

## The Real Mapping

### What We Actually Need

Based on **SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md**:

| Vision Component | Purpose | What We Need |
|------------------|---------|--------------|
| **Members** (`Me√∞limir`) | Authentication, member registry, permissions | ‚úÖ **Firebase + Kenni.is** (built) |
| **Events** (`Atbur√∞ir`) | Election administration, issue voting tokens, manage election lifecycle | ‚ùì **Not Built Yet** |
| **Elections** (`Kosningar`) | Accept voting tokens, record ballots anonymously | ‚ùì **Partially matches Ekklesia Voting** |

### What We Have (Ekklesia Platform)

| Component | Purpose | How We're Using It |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Ekklesia Portal** | Motion/proposition management | ü§î **Unclear fit** |
| **Ekklesia Voting** | Vote on motions/propositions | ü§î **Could work for elections?** |

---

## The Confusion Explained

### Why the Confusion Happened

1. **Similar names**: "Portal" sounds like it could manage "events"
2. **Voting component**: Ekklesia Voting handles ballots, which matches vision
3. **Assumed mapping**: We assumed Portal = Events, Voting = Elections

### Why This Might Not Work

**Ekklesia Portal** is designed for:
- **Motions**: Policy proposals, initiatives, propositions
- **Debate**: Discussion threads, comments, amendments
- **Lifecycle**: Draft ‚Üí Discussion ‚Üí Vote ‚Üí Accepted/Rejected

**Our "Events" (`Atbur√∞ir`)** needs:
- **Elections**: Officer elections, board votes, referendums
- **Eligibility**: Who can vote (based on membership status, roles)
- **Token Issuance**: Generate one-time voting tokens for eligible members
- **Results**: Fetch results from voting system, display to authorized users

**These are different concepts:**
- **Motion**: "We propose to change party policy on X"
- **Election**: "Who should be party treasurer? Vote for A, B, or C"

## Three Possible Paths Forward

### Option 1: Use Ekklesia Platform As-Is (Adapt Vision)

**Approach**: Change our vision to match what Ekklesia Portal does

**Pros**:
- Mature, production-ready platform
- Already deployed (Portal at 503, fixable)
- Rich features (motion management, voting)

**Cons**:
- **Doesn't match original vision** (motions ‚â† elections)
- May not support election-specific features (candidate lists, ranked choice, etc.)
- Token issuance model might not match S2S design

**Best for**: If party wants motion-based democracy more than elections

### Option 2: Build Custom "Events" Component (Keep Vision)

**Approach**: Build a custom Events (`Atbur√∞ir`) service that matches the vision

**Components**:
- Custom Events service (election administration)
- Ekklesia Voting (use for actual ballot casting)
- Custom integration layer (S2S token issuance)

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Matches original architectural vision exactly
- ‚úÖ Designed specifically for elections (not motions)
- ‚úÖ S2S token issuance as designed
- ‚úÖ Eligibility rules customized for party needs

**Cons**:
- Need to build Events service from scratch
- More development time
- Maintenance burden

**Best for**: If original vision is critical requirement

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Use Ekklesia + Extend)

**Approach**: Use Ekklesia Portal but extend it for election management

**Modifications**:
- Use Portal for both motions AND elections
- Add election-specific features to Portal
- Extend token issuance for S2S integration
- Customize eligibility rules

**Pros**:
- Leverage existing Ekklesia platform
- Add election-specific features as needed
- Keep mature voting component

**Cons**:
- Requires modifying Ekklesia Portal (fork or contribute upstream)
- Need to understand Ekklesia codebase deeply
- Maintenance overhead for custom changes

**Best for**: Want both motions AND elections in one platform

## Questions That Need Answers

1. **What does the party actually need?**
   - Elections (officer elections, board votes)?
   - Motions/propositions (policy decisions)?
   - Both?

2. **Can Ekklesia Portal handle elections?**
   - Need to review Ekklesia Portal features
   - Check if it supports election-style voting (vs motion voting)
   - Verify token issuance model

3. **Is the S2S token design critical?**
   - Original vision: Events ‚Üí Voting (S2S token issuance)
   - Ekklesia: Portal ‚Üí Voting (how does it work?)
   - Can we adapt the vision to Ekklesia's model?

4. **What did we deploy Portal for?**
   - Why did we deploy Ekklesia Portal if we need Events?
   - Was this a conscious decision or assumption?
   - What was the reasoning?

---

## Current Deployment Reality

**What's Actually Deployed**:

```
Members (Firebase) ‚Üí ??? ‚Üí Portal (503) ‚Üí ??? ‚Üí Voting (not deployed)
                      ‚Üë                    ‚Üë
                   UNCLEAR              UNCLEAR
```

**Issues**:
1. Portal is deployed but we haven't verified it matches our needs
2. Integration between Members ‚Üí Portal is undefined
3. Integration between Portal ‚Üí Voting is assumed but not designed
4. Original "Events" concept may not exist in current plan

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Fixing Portal 503)

1. **Clarify Requirements**
   - Review with party: Do we need elections, motions, or both?
   - Confirm if original vision (SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md) is still valid
   - Define what "Events" actually means in practice

2. **Evaluate Ekklesia Portal**
   - Research Ekklesia Portal capabilities
   - Check if it supports election-style voting
   - Review integration model with Voting component
   - Assess if it can handle token issuance as designed

3. **Make Architectural Decision**
   - Option 1: Adapt vision to Ekklesia (motions-based)
   - Option 2: Build custom Events (elections-based)
   - Option 3: Extend Ekklesia (hybrid)

### After Decision

**If Option 1 (Use Ekklesia As-Is)**:
- Fix Portal 503 issue
- Update architectural vision document
- Design Members ‚Üí Portal integration
- Deploy Voting service

**If Option 2 (Build Custom Events)**:
- Deprecate Portal deployment
- Design custom Events service
- Keep Ekklesia Voting (or build custom)
- Implement S2S token issuance

**If Option 3 (Hybrid)**:
- Fix Portal 503 issue
- Extend Portal for election support
- Customize token issuance
- Deploy Voting service

---

## Key Insight

**We deployed Ekklesia Portal (motions platform) but our vision described Events (election administration).**

**These are NOT the same thing.**

We need to decide:
1. Is our vision still valid?
2. Can Ekklesia Portal satisfy our vision?
3. Or do we need a different approach?

**This is an architectural decision that needs input from party stakeholders.**
