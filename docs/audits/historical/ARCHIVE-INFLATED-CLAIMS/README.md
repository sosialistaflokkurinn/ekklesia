# ARCHIVE - Inflated Claims (Historical Reference Only)

**Date Archived:** October 21, 2025
**Reason:** These documents contain inflated quality claims that have been corrected

## What's Here

These documents were created during Phase 2 but contain overstated quality assessments:

- "Production ready" status claims (premature)
- Marketing language instead of honest assessment
- Incomplete testing representation
