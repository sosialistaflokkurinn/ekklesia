# Branch Comparison Task: Firebase Auth → Security Hardening

**Task**: Compare changes between `feature/firebase-members-auth` and `feature/security-hardening` branches, evaluate documentation, and recommend archival actions.

**Project**: Ekklesia e-democracy platform (GCP project: ekklesia-prod-10-2025)

**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/sosialistaflokkurinn/ekklesia

---

## Your Mission

You will:
1. Fetch both branches from GitHub
2. Generate complete diff between `feature/firebase-members-auth` and `feature/security-hardening`
3. Analyze all documentation changes (.md, .txt, README files)
4. Evaluate which documentation is current vs historical
5. Recommend archival actions for obsolete documentation
6. Validate the documentation map
7. Provide merge recommendation

---

## Step 1: Setup - Fetch Branches from GitHub

### Check Current Branch

```bash
# See current branch
git branch --show-current
```

**Expected**: `feature/security-hardening`

### Fetch Latest from Remote

```bash
# Fetch all branches from origin
git fetch origin

# List all remote branches
git branch -r | grep -E "(firebase-members-auth|security-hardening)"
```

**Expected Output**:
```
  origin/feature/firebase-members-auth
  origin/feature/security-hardening
```

### Verify Branches Exist

```bash
# Check firebase-members-auth branch exists
git show-ref --verify refs/remotes/origin/feature/firebase-members-auth

# Check security-hardening branch exists
git show-ref --verify refs/remotes/origin/feature/security-hardening
```

If either branch doesn't exist locally, fetch it:

```bash
# Ensure you have local tracking branches
git branch -a | grep -E "(firebase|security)"
```

---

## Step 2: Generate Branch Comparison

### Important: Correct Branch Comparison

**Base Branch**: `origin/feature/firebase-members-auth` (older)
**Compare Branch**: `origin/feature/security-hardening` (newer)

We want to see: "What changed from Firebase Auth branch to Security Hardening branch?"

### Generate Diff Statistics

```bash
# Summary statistics (files changed, lines added/removed)
git diff --stat origin/feature/firebase-members-auth...origin/feature/security-hardening

# Save to file for analysis
git diff --stat origin/feature/firebase-members-auth...origin/feature/security-hardening > /tmp/branch-diff-stats.txt

# Count total files changed
git diff --stat origin/feature/firebase-members-auth...origin/feature/security-hardening | tail -1
```

**Expected Output Format**:
```
 docs/status/CURRENT_PRODUCTION_STATUS.md | 145 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 members/public/js/login.new.js           |  89 +++++++++++++++++++
 ...
 49 files changed, 9454 insertions(+), 1280 deletions(-)
```

### Generate Full Diff

```bash
# Full diff (all changes)
git diff origin/feature/firebase-members-auth...origin/feature/security-hardening > /tmp/full-branch-diff.txt

# Check file size
wc -l /tmp/full-branch-diff.txt
```

**Warning**: This file will be very large (likely 10,000+ lines). Use with care.

### List Changed Files by Category

```bash
# List only documentation files changed
git diff --name-only origin/feature/firebase-members-auth...origin/feature/security-hardening | grep '\.md$'

# List by status (Added, Modified, Deleted)
git diff --name-status origin/feature/firebase-members-auth...origin/feature/security-hardening

# Count by file type
git diff --name-status origin/feature/firebase-members-auth...origin/feature/security-hardening | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c
```

**Output Format**:
- `A` = Added (new file)
- `M` = Modified (changed file)
- `D` = Deleted (removed file)
- `R100` = Renamed (100% similar)

### Get Commit Log Difference

```bash
# See all commits on security-hardening not in firebase-members-auth
git log origin/feature/firebase-members-auth..origin/feature/security-hardening --oneline

# Count commits
git log origin/feature/firebase-members-auth..origin/feature/security-hardening --oneline | wc -l

# See detailed commit messages
git log origin/feature/firebase-members-auth..origin/feature/security-hardening \
  --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s" \
  --reverse
```

---

## Step 3: Analyze Documentation Changes

### Find All Documentation Files Changed

```bash
# All .md files changed
git diff --name-status origin/feature/firebase-members-auth...origin/feature/security-hardening | grep '\.md$'

# Separate by status
echo "=== NEW DOCUMENTATION ==="
git diff --name-status origin/feature/firebase-members-auth...origin/feature/security-hardening | grep '^A.*\.md$'

echo "=== MODIFIED DOCUMENTATION ==="
git diff --name-status origin/feature/firebase-members-auth...origin/feature/security-hardening | grep '^M.*\.md$'

echo "=== DELETED DOCUMENTATION ==="
git diff --name-status origin/feature/firebase-members-auth...origin/feature/security-hardening | grep '^D.*\.md$'
```

### Read Specific Documentation Diff

For each important documentation file, examine the changes:

```bash
# Example: See what changed in CURRENT_PRODUCTION_STATUS.md
git diff origin/feature/firebase-members-auth...origin/feature/security-hardening \
  -- docs/status/CURRENT_PRODUCTION_STATUS.md | head -100

# See only added lines (new content)
git diff origin/feature/firebase-members-auth...origin/feature/security-hardening \
  -- docs/status/CURRENT_PRODUCTION_STATUS.md | grep '^+' | grep -v '^+++' | head -50

# See only removed lines (deleted content)
git diff origin/feature/firebase-members-auth...origin/feature/security-hardening \
  -- docs/status/CURRENT_PRODUCTION_STATUS.md | grep '^-' | grep -v '^---' | head -50
```

### Compare File Content Between Branches

```bash
# Read file from firebase-members-auth branch
git show origin/feature/firebase-members-auth:docs/status/CURRENT_PRODUCTION_STATUS.md | head -50

# Read file from security-hardening branch
git show origin/feature/security-hardening:docs/status/CURRENT_PRODUCTION_STATUS.md | head -50

# Side-by-side comparison (if available)
git difftool origin/feature/firebase-members-auth origin/feature/security-hardening \
  -- docs/status/CURRENT_PRODUCTION_STATUS.md
```

---

## Step 4: Categorize Documentation

For each documentation file, determine if it should be:

### Keep in Active Documentation (`/docs`)

**Criteria**:
- **Current**: Describes active services or current state
- **Operational**: Needed to run/maintain the system
- **Maintained**: Will be updated regularly
- **Reference**: Team needs frequent access

**Examples**:
- `docs/status/CURRENT_PRODUCTION_STATUS.md` - Active system status
- `docs/OPERATIONAL_PROCEDURES.md` - Meeting procedures
- `docs/USAGE_CONTEXT.md` - Load patterns
- `docs/design/EVENTS_SERVICE_MVP.md` - Active service design
- `docs/testing/END_TO_END_VOTING_FLOW_TEST.md` - Recent test results

### Archive to `/archive` Directory

**Criteria**:
- **Historical**: Describes past state or completed work
- **Superseded**: Replaced by newer documentation
- **One-time**: Investigation notes, completed migrations
- **Legacy**: Documentation for decommissioned services

**Examples**:
- Testing logs from completed deployments
- Migration guides (after migration is done)
- Service documentation for deleted services (ZITADEL, old Members service)
- Investigation notes (after issue is resolved)
- Temporary design proposals (after implementation)

### Review Categories

Go through each file and ask:

1. **Is this about current or past state?**
   - Current → Keep
   - Past → Archive

2. **Will someone need this next month?**
   - Yes → Keep
   - No → Archive

3. **Is this service/feature still active?**
   - Active → Keep
   - Decommissioned → Archive

4. **Is this a one-time document?**
   - Ongoing reference → Keep
   - One-time (testing log, migration guide) → Archive

---

## Step 5: Verify Service Status with GCP Tools

Before archiving service documentation, verify the service is truly gone.

### Check Cloud Run Services

```bash
# List all active Cloud Run services
gcloud run services list \
  --region=europe-west2 \
  --project=ekklesia-prod-10-2025 \
  --format="table(SERVICE,URL,LAST_MODIFIED)"
```

**Active Services** (as of Oct 15, 2025):
- `elections-service` ✅
- `events-service` ✅
- `handlekenniauth` ✅
- `verifymembership` ✅

**Decommissioned Services** (can archive docs):
- `members` (replaced by Firebase Hosting)
- `zitadel` (replaced by Firebase Auth)
- `portal` (evaluated and rejected)

### Check if Specific Service Exists

```bash
# Example: Check if old 'members' service still exists
gcloud run services describe members \
  --region=europe-west2 \
  --project=ekklesia-prod-10-2025 2>&1

# If you see "ERROR: Cannot find service", docs can be archived
```

### Check Firebase Hosting

```bash
# Check current Firebase deployments
firebase hosting:sites:list --project=ekklesia-prod-10-2025

# Check current version
firebase hosting:channel:list --project=ekklesia-prod-10-2025
```

### Check Secret Manager (for decommissioned services)

```bash
# List all secrets
gcloud secrets list --project=ekklesia-prod-10-2025

# Check if old ZITADEL secrets exist
gcloud secrets describe zitadel-db-password \
  --project=ekklesia-prod-10-2025 2>&1

# If "ERROR: Secret not found", service is fully decommissioned
```

---

## Step 6: Examine New Documentation

### Identify All New Files

```bash
# List all new .md files
git diff --name-status origin/feature/firebase-members-auth...origin/feature/security-hardening | grep '^A.*\.md$'
```

For each new file, answer:

1. **What is the purpose?** (read first 20 lines)
   ```bash
   git show origin/feature/security-hardening:PATH/TO/FILE.md | head -20
   ```

2. **Is it current or historical?**
   - Look for dates in filename (e.g., `TESTING_LOG_2025-10-15.md` = likely historical)
   - Look for "Status: Active" vs "Status: Archived" in content
   - Look for verbs: "Design" (current) vs "Testing Log" (historical)

3. **Should it be tracked or archived?**
   - Testing guides for current architecture → Keep
   - Testing logs from completed deployments → Archive
   - Design docs for active services → Keep
   - Design docs for abandoned proposals → Archive

### Examples of New Documentation to Review

Based on the commit message, these files were added:

**New Documentation** (review each):
- `docs/testing/END_TO_END_VOTING_FLOW_TEST.md`
- `docs/prompts/BRANCH_DIFF_DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT.md`
- `docs/reviews/PR28_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
- `docs/reviews/PR29_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
- `docs/integration/DJANGO_SYNC_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `docs/integration/DJANGO_TO_EKKLESIA_MIGRATION.md`
- `docs/legacy/DJANGO_LEGACY_SYSTEM.md`
- `docs/status/README.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`

**Member Documentation** (review each):
- `members/public/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR.md`
- `members/public/CRITICAL_FIXES.md`
- `members/public/FRONTEND_AUDIT_2025-10-15.md`
- `members/public/TESTING_GUIDE.md`

**Questions to Ask**:
1. Is `END_TO_END_VOTING_FLOW_TEST.md` a test report (historical) or testing guide (current)?
2. Are PR audit reports one-time reviews (archive) or ongoing references (keep)?
3. Is Django integration documentation for future work (keep) or legacy reference (archive)?
4. Are frontend audit reports ongoing (keep) or one-time (archive after addressed)?

---

## Step 7: Check Archive Structure

### Explore Current Archive

```bash
# List archive directory structure
find /home/gudro/Development/projects/ekklesia/archive -type d -maxdepth 3

# See what's already archived
ls -R /home/gudro/Development/projects/ekklesia/archive/
```

**Current Archive Structure** (as of Oct 15, 2025):

```
archive/
├── docs/                          # Obsolete documentation
│   ├── docs-2025-10-13/          # Documentation consolidated Oct 13
│   │   ├── claude/               # Old .claude/ directory
│   │   └── docs/                 # Old docs structure
│   └── reviews/                  # PR review responses
│       ├── pr28/
│       └── pr29-drafts/
├── ops/                          # Operational history
│   └── testing-logs/             # Completed testing logs
│       └── EVENTS_SERVICE_TESTING_LOG.md
├── projects/                     # Abandoned/evaluated projects
│   ├── ekklesia-platform-evaluation/
│   └── zitadel-legacy/
└── tools/                        # Deprecated scripts/utilities
    └── legacy/
```

### Determine Where to Archive

**Decision Tree**:

1. **Service documentation** (for decommissioned service):
   - `archive/projects/<service-name>/`
   - Example: `archive/projects/zitadel-legacy/`

2. **Testing logs** (completed deployment/migration):
   - `archive/ops/testing-logs/`
   - Example: `archive/ops/testing-logs/EVENTS_SERVICE_TESTING_LOG.md`

3. **One-time documentation** (design proposals, investigations):
   - `archive/docs/docs-<YYYY-MM-DD>/`
   - Example: `archive/docs/docs-2025-10-15/`

4. **PR review responses** (after PR merged):
   - `archive/docs/reviews/pr<NUMBER>/`
   - Example: `archive/docs/reviews/pr28/`

---

## Step 8: Validate Documentation Map

### Run Validation Script

```bash
# Run the validation script
cd /home/gudro/Development/projects/ekklesia
python validate_documentation_map.py
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ All referenced files exist
Referenced paths: 93
Documentation files not in map: 0
```

**If there are errors**:
```
❌ Missing file: docs/some-file.md
```

Action: Either add the file to `DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md` or determine if it should be archived.

### Check for Undocumented Files

```bash
# Find all .md files in docs/ that aren't in the map
comm -13 \
  <(grep -o 'docs/[^)]*\.md' DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md | sort -u) \
  <(git ls-files 'docs/**/*.md' | sort)
```

**If files are listed**:
- Review each file
- Add to `DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md` if active
- Move to archive if obsolete

## Step 9: Generate Summary Report

Create a comprehensive summary using this template:

```bash
cat > /tmp/branch-comparison-report-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md <<'EOF'
