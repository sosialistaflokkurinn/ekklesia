# Ekklesia Portal

üü° **Status**: Deployed to GCP Cloud Run but not operational (dependency issues)
üìç **Production URL**: https://portal-ymzrguoifa-nw.a.run.app (returns 503)
üìÑ **Deployment Guide**: See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for current status and resolution steps

This repository is part of the [Ekklesia e-democracy](https://ekklesiademocracy.org)
platform. It provides the motion portal Web UI, the public API and administrative interface.

## Current Deployment Status (Samsta√∞a)

**Project**: ekklesia-prod-10-2025 (GCP)
**Region**: europe-west2 (London)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-07

### Infrastructure

‚úÖ **Cloud SQL Database**
- Instance: `ekklesia-db`
- Version: PostgreSQL 15
- Tier: db-f1-micro (614 MB RAM, shared CPU)
- Database: `ekklesia_portal` (created, empty)
- User: `ekklesia_portal`

‚úÖ **Cloud Run Service**
- Service: `portal`
- Memory: 512 MB
- CPU: 1
- Concurrency: 80
- Environment: DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET (from Secret Manager)

‚ùå **Current Issue**
- Service returns HTTP 503
- Root cause: Container crashes on startup (Python dependency resolution)
- Migrations: 24 Alembic migrations pending (blocked by 503)

**See**: [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete infrastructure setup and troubleshooting

### Integration with Members Service

The Portal service integrates with the Members authentication system:

- **Authentication**: Firebase/Identity Platform custom tokens
- **National eID**: Kenni.is OAuth PKCE integration
- **Member Verification**: Cloud Function verifies kennitala against membership list
- **User Profile**: Firestore stores user profiles and kennitala mapping

**Members Service**: https://members-ymzrguoifa-nw.a.run.app (operational)

## Development

To get a consistent development environment, we use
[Nix](https://nixos.org/nix) to install Python and the project
dependencies. The development environment also includes PostgreSQL,
code linters, a SASS compiler and pytest for running the tests.

### Development Quick Start

This section describes briefly how to set up a development environment to run a local instance of the application.

Setting up the environment for testing and running tests is described in the
section [Testing](https://docs.ekklesiademocracy.org/en/latest/development/testing.html)
in the Ekklesia documentation.

The following instructions assume that *Nix* is already installed, has Nix
flakes enabled, and an empty + writable PostgreSQL database can be accessed somehow.

If you don't have *Nix* with Flakes support and or can't use an existing
PostgreSQL server, have a look at the [Development Environment](https://docs.ekklesiademocracy.org/en/latest/development/dev_env.html)
section in the Ekklesia documentation.

It's strongly recommended to also follow the instructions at
`Setting up the Cachix Binary Cache <https://docs.ekklesiademocracy.org/en/latest/development/dev_env.html#setting-up-the-cachix-binary-cache>`
or the first step will take a long time to complete.

1. Clone the repository and enter nix shell in the project root folder to open a shell which is
   your dev environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sosialistaflokkurinn/ekklesia
   cd ekklesia/portal
   nix develop
   ```

2. Compile translations and CSS (look at `dodo.py` to see what this does):

   ```bash
   doit
   ```

3. Create a config file named `config.yml` using the config template
   from `src/ekklesia_portal/config.example.yml` or skip this to use
   the default settings from `src/ekklesia_portal/default_settings.py`.
   Make sure that the database connection string points to an
   empty + writable database.

4. Set up the dev database (look at `flake.nix` to see what this does):

   ```bash
   create_dev_db
   ```

5. Run the development server (look at `flake.nix` to see what this does):
   ```bash
   run_dev
   ```

Run `help` to see all commonly used dev shell commands.

## Running In Production

### Samsta√∞a GCP Deployment

**Current Method**: Docker container on Cloud Run (see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md))

The Portal service is deployed to GCP Cloud Run using:
- Cloud SQL PostgreSQL 15 for database
- Secret Manager for credentials
- Cloud Run for containerized application
- Alembic for database migrations

**Deployment Scripts**:
- `setup-database.sh` - Create database and user
- `deploy-to-cloud-run.sh` - Build and deploy container
- `run-migrations.sh` - Run Alembic migrations (blocked by 503 issue)

**Current Issue**: Container deployment successful but service returns 503 due to Python dependency resolution. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for resolution options.

### Original Nix-based Production (Alternative)

A production environment can also be built by Nix. The generated output
doesn't have additional requirements. The application can be run by a
start script directly, using the included NixOS module or the Docker image
built by Nix. Static assets are built separately and can be served by the
included minimal Nginx. As for the application itself, we can build a
standalone start script or a Docker image.

See the [Ekklesia Operations Manual](https://docs.ekklesiademocracy.org/en/latest/operations/index.html)
for more information about Nix-based deployments.

## History

Ekklesia Portal started as an improved implementation of Wikiarguments
in Python 3.x using the Flask micro web framework. The project is now
based on the [Morepath](https://github.com/morepath/morepath) web
framework and tries to explore ideas from the Ruby project
[Trailblazer](https://trailblazer.to).

**Samsta√∞a Deployment**: Deployed to GCP Cloud Run as part of the Ekklesia platform for the Icelandic Social Democratic Party (Samsta√∞a), integrated with Kenni.is national eID system and Firebase/Identity Platform for authentication.
