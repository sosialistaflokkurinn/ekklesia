## ⏳ Pending Tasks

### 1. Apply Database Migrations 006-012

**Status**: Ready to apply (script created but needs Cloud SQL proxy)

**Migrations to Apply**:
- 006_add_question_column.sql
- 007_add_answers_column.sql
- 008_fix_question_text_constraint.sql
- 009_fix_voting_times_constraint.sql
- 010_fix_correlation_id_type.sql
- 011_drop_old_status_constraint.sql
- 012_add_voting_tokens_columns.sql

**Manual Steps Required**:

```bash
# 1. Start Cloud SQL proxy (in a separate terminal)
cloud_sql_proxy -instances=ekklesia-prod-10-2025:europe-west2:ekklesia-db=tcp:5432

# 2. Get database password
DB_PASSWORD=$(gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret="postgres-password" --project=ekklesia-prod-10-2025)

# 3. Apply migrations one by one
cd /home/gudro/Development/projects/ekklesia/services/events

for i in {006..012}; do
  MIGRATION_FILE="migrations/${i}_*.sql"
  echo "Applying $(basename $MIGRATION_FILE)..."
  PGPASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres -f $MIGRATION_FILE
done

# 4. Verify migrations
PGPASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres <<EOF
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'elections'
  AND table_name = 'elections'
  AND column_name IN ('question', 'answers')
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
EOF
```

**Alternative**: Use the migration script `/tmp/apply_migrations_006_012.sh` after starting Cloud SQL proxy.

### 2. Merge PR #102

**Option 1: Squash Merge via GitHub CLI**:
```bash
cd /home/gudro/Development/projects/ekklesia
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Squash merge PR #102
gh pr merge 102 --squash \
  --subject "feat(epic-24): Complete Admin Election Lifecycle Management API" \
  --body "Implements full admin API with 16 endpoints for election lifecycle management, including fixes for JSON parsing, database joins, and voting times persistence. Includes frontend improvements (hamburger menu, i18n, CSS variables). Closes #24 and related issues #71-#91."
```

**Option 2: Manual Squash Merge**:
```bash
cd /home/gudro/Development/projects/ekklesia
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Squash merge the branch
git merge --squash feature/epic-24-admin-lifecycle

# Commit with comprehensive message
git commit -m "feat(epic-24): Complete Admin Election Lifecycle Management API

Implements full admin API with 16 endpoints for election lifecycle management:
- Create, read, update, delete elections
- Publish, open, close, archive lifecycle operations
- Token generation and management
- Results aggregation with proper anonymity
- Complete audit logging

Fixes:
- JSON parsing error in results endpoint
- Missing election_id column (proper JOIN with voting_tokens)
- Voting times persistence in PATCH endpoint

Frontend improvements:
- Hamburger menu for mobile navigation
- Removed hardcoded Icelandic strings (i18n via R.strings)
- CSS variables for theming
- Fixed dynamic import anti-pattern

Database migrations 006-012 included for schema updates.

Closes #24, #71-#91"

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

### 3. Begin Epic #43 (Membership Sync)

**Prerequisites**:
- ✅ Epic #24 merged to main
- ✅ Database migrations applied
- ⏳ Django backend API endpoint available

**Next Steps**:
1. Create branch `feature/epic-43-membership-sync` from updated main
2. Review Epic #43 specification in `docs/features/election-voting/EPIC_43_MEMBERSHIP_SYNC.md`
3. Implement membership-sync service
4. Set up Cloud Scheduler for hourly sync

## Commit Analysis: Epic #24 vs Epic #87

**Commits on Epic #24 not on main**: 25 total

**Frontend-related commits** (could be considered Epic #87):
- 7f1ac94e: fix(hamburger-menu) - 7 critical fixes
- 9a51a0d3: feat: add hamburger menu
- ab2efde9: fix(frontend) - remove dynamic import anti-pattern
- bc1140df: refactor: remove hardcoded Icelandic from login
- a9132669: refactor: remove hardcoded Icelandic strings
- 6f98bec1: refactor: replace hardcoded colors with CSS variables

**Decision**: These commits are appropriately on Epic #24 branch as they're production-readiness improvements that support the admin UI. They will be included in the squash merge to main.

## Production Readiness Checklist

### Pre-Merge

- [x] Bugs fixed and verified
- [x] Code committed and pushed
- [x] Events service deployed to production
- [x] PR #102 created with comprehensive description

### Post-Merge

### Production Smoke Test Script

```bash
# Get production Firebase token with developer role
# (via web app: https://ekklesia-prod-10-2025.web.app)

export FIREBASE_TOKEN="<your-production-token>"

# Test admin API endpoints
curl -s -X POST "https://events-service-521240388393.europe-west2.run.app/api/admin/elections" \
