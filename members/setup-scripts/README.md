This directory has been consolidated. Please use the unified scripts in `members/scripts`.

- Role management CLI: `members/scripts/set-user-roles.js`
- Documentation: `members/scripts/README.md`

Security:
- Requires a service account with permission to manage custom claims.
- Do not commit keys; use Application Default Credentials or Secret Manager.
