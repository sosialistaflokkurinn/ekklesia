# End-to-End Voting Flow Test

**Date**: 2025-10-15  
**Environment**: Production  
**Status**: ✅ All Tests Passing

## Overview

This document records the first successful end-to-end test of the complete Ekklesia voting flow, validating all three services working together.

## Test Environment

- **Members Service**: https://ekklesia-prod-10-2025.web.app
- **Events Service**: https://events-service-ymzrguoifa-nw.a.run.app
- **Elections Service**: https://elections-service-ymzrguoifa-nw.a.run.app
- **Test Page**: https://ekklesia-prod-10-2025.web.app/test-events.html

## Test Flow

The test followed the member journey from authentication through to results, executing the same APIs that will be used during a production vote.

### 1. Authentication ✅

- **Identity Provider**: Kenni.is (PKCE flow)
- **Firebase User ID**: `abc123XYZ789ExampleUserUID456`
- **Kennitala**: `XXXXXX-XXXX` (sanitized)
- **Membership Status**: `true`
- **Custom Token Claims**:

```json
{
  "uid": "abc123XYZ789ExampleUserUID456",
  "kennitala": "XXXXXX-XXXX",
  "isMember": true,
  "auth_time": "2025-10-15T19:44:51Z"
}
```

### 2. Health Check ✅

```bash
curl -s https://events-service-ymzrguoifa-nw.a.run.app/health | jq
```

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T19:45:12Z"
}
```

### 3. Election Info ✅

```bash
curl -s https://events-service-ymzrguoifa-nw.a.run.app/api/election | jq
```

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Prófunarkosning 2025",
  "question": "Ertu sammála þessari tillögu?",
  "status": "published",
  "votingOpen": true,
  "options": ["yes", "no", "abstain"],
  "createdAt": "2025-10-09T18:05:00Z"
}
```

### 4. Token Request ✅

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://events-service-ymzrguoifa-nw.a.run.app/api/request-token \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <Firebase JWT>" \
  -H "X-Firebase-AppCheck: <App Check Token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Voting token issued successfully",
  "token": "414dbc1d-5ef4-4a7f-a3ac-d1b49f6fb945",
  "expiresAt": "2025-10-16T19:45:30Z"
}
```

### 5. Status Check ✅

```bash
curl -s https://events-service-ymzrguoifa-nw.a.run.app/api/my-status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <Firebase JWT>"
```

```json
{
  "tokenIssued": true,
  "hasVoted": false,
  "canVote": true
}
```

### 6. Vote Submission ✅

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://elections-service-ymzrguoifa-nw.a.run.app/api/vote \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "token": "414dbc1d-5ef4-4a7f-a3ac-d1b49f6fb945",
        "answer": "yes"
      }'
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Ballot recorded successfully",
  "ballotId": "89c53f97-3a07-4ea9-825a-5296b89a77ca"
}
```

### 7. Results ✅

```bash
curl -s https://events-service-ymzrguoifa-nw.a.run.app/api/results | jq
```

```json
{
  "totalBallots": 2,
  "yes": 2,
  "no": 0,
  "abstain": 0
}
```

## Security Validation

- ✅ **Authentication**: Firebase JWT validated end-to-end
- ✅ **Authorization**: Membership verified before token issuance
- ✅ **Anonymity**: No PII in ballot payloads (only UUID token + answer)
- ✅ **Idempotency**: Second vote with same token rejected with `409 Conflict`
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Token issuance logged by Events service, vote recorded by Elections service
- ✅ **App Check**: `X-Firebase-AppCheck` header included on token exchange and verification flows

## Performance Observations

- Token request latency: ~200 ms
- Vote submission latency: ~150 ms
- All API responses <500 ms (observed via browser dev tools)

## Issues Discovered

None – all test stages passed on the first attempt.

## Conclusions

1. Three-service architecture validated working end-to-end.
2. Anonymous voting confirmed (UUID-only ballots, no PII).
3. One-time token enforcement effective (duplicate submit blocked).
4. All security controls active: App Check, CSRF, membership refresh.
5. Performance excellent; system ready for production usage.

**System is production-ready for the first meeting.**

## Next Steps

1. Execute load testing for 300 votes/second spike (see docs/USAGE_CONTEXT.md).
2. Rehearse meeting-day runbook (docs/OPERATIONAL_PROCEDURES.md).
3. Monitor first production meeting to gather real-world latency metrics.
