# Phase 5 Week 1 Master Implementation Plan

**Period**: October 28 - November 1, 2025
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Ready to Launch
**Target**: Complete foundation for Epics #24, #43, and begin #87

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 5 Week 1 kicks off three parallel epics that will transform Ekklesia from infrastructure into a fully functional voting system:

- **Epic #24** (Admin Lifecycle): Backend API for election management
- **Epic #43** (Membership Sync): Hourly member synchronization service
- **Epic #87** (Member UI): Preparation for member voting interface

All three epics run **in parallel**, with careful dependency management.

## Pre-Phase 5 Checklist

**Target Completion**: Friday, October 25, 2025 (before Monday kickoff)

Complete these tasks before Phase 5 Week 1 starts to ensure smooth execution.

### Infrastructure Verification (Owner: DevOps)

## Critical Dependencies

### External Dependencies
1. **Django Backend API** (for Epic #43)
   - **What**: Member list endpoint with pagination
   - **Format**: `{ "results": [{ "id", "kennitala", "name", "email" }] }`
   - **When Needed**: By Friday, Oct 31
   - **Blocker Risk**: HIGH - Affects Epic #43 testing
   - **Mitigation**: Mock API ready by Wednesday if real API not available

2. **Design Approval** (for Epic #87)
   - **What**: Sign-off on UI mockups
   - **When Needed**: By Friday, Nov 1
   - **Blocker Risk**: MEDIUM - Only delays #87 Week 2 start
   - **Mitigation**: Proceed with current mockups; revise if needed

### Internal Dependencies
1. **Epic #24 â†’ Epic #87**
   - Epic #24 API must be working for Epic #87 to test voting
   - **Timeline**: Testing starts Week 2, when #24 foundation ready
   - **Risk**: LOW - Dependency well-managed

2. **Epic #43 â†’ Epic #24**
   - Membership data required for token generation
   - **Timeline**: Both finish Week 1; coordinate Monday (deadline for member import)
   - **Risk**: LOW - Both teams aware

2. If unresolved in 2 hours: escalate to tech lead
3. If blocking entire team: escalate to project lead
4. Critical blockers: email + Slack notification

---

## Testing & Quality Gates

### Code Quality
- ESLint: All code must pass linting
- Unit tests: >90% coverage for new code
- Integration tests: All critical paths tested
- Code review: All PRs require 1 approval

### Performance
- API response time: <500ms (p95)
- Database queries: Optimized, <100ms (p95)
- Token generation: 1000 tokens/second minimum
- Sync operation: <5 minutes for 10,000 members

### Security
- SQL injection: Parameterized queries only
- Authentication: Firebase tokens verified
- Authorization: Role checks on all endpoints
- Audit logging: Complete trail of all actions
- Secrets: No secrets in code, use environment variables

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **Django API not ready** (Epic #43)
   - Impact: Cannot test membership sync with real data
   - Probability: MEDIUM
   - Mitigation: Mock API ready; plan to integrate real API Week 2

2. **Database performance** (Epic #24)
   - Impact: Admin API slow with large member counts
   - Probability: MEDIUM
   - Mitigation: Load test Friday; optimize indexes if needed

### Medium Risk
1. **Token generation speed** (Epic #24)
   - Impact: Cannot open elections with many members
   - Probability: LOW
   - Mitigation: Implement batching if needed

2. **Design delays** (Epic #87)
   - Impact: Week 2 implementation delayed
   - Probability: LOW
   - Mitigation: Start with current mockups; iterate

### Low Risk
1. **Team member absence**
   - Mitigation: Cross-training; pair programming setup
2. **Git conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Different feature branches; merge Monday before Phase 5 starts
