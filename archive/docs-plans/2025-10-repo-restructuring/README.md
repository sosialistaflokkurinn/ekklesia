## What Was Accomplished

The Ekklesia repository underwent a major restructuring on October 21, 2025 to prepare for Phase 5 growth. The reorganization moved from a flat service structure to a domain-organized hierarchy.

### Key Changes

**Before (MVP Structure)**:
```
ekklesia/
├── members/
├── events/
├── elections/
└── docs/
```

**After (Scalable Structure)**:
```
ekklesia/
├── services/
│   ├── members/
│   ├── events/
│   └── elections/
├── apps/
│   └── members-portal/
├── docs/
├── infrastructure/
├── testing/
└── scripts/
```

### Implementation Details

- **Commit**: f3ecc28
- **Files Moved**: 100+ files reorganized
- **Documentation Updated**: 35+ references updated in DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md
- **Approach**: Multi-agent workflow (Human → Sonnet → Haiku execution)
